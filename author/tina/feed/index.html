										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cantonese Rice is the best-known recipe in Chinese cuisine, along with <a href="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//ravioli-cinesi-al-vapore/">steamed dumplings, </a> spring rolls, and chicken with almonds! This recipe is based on basmati rice first boiled (best the day before!) and then stir-fried in a pan or Wok with scrambled eggs, peas, ham and gaberetti! A simple, quick, tasty and colorful dish, the whole family likes it and the kids love it! Prepare Cantonese rice and serve it with the famous chopsticks, just Chinese style! Ingredients for two/three people:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 tablespoon Chinese wine</li>
<li>1 tablespoon oyster sauce</li>
<li>2 tablespoons of soy sauce</li>
<li>2 tablespoons seed oil</li>
<li>2 spring onions</li>
<li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
<li>200 g basmati or Jasmine rice</li>
<li>2 eggs</li>
<li>150 g frozen peas</li>
<li>150 gr fresh or frozen shrimps</li>
<li>150 gr diced cooked ham</li>
<li>salt to taste.</li>
</ul>
<p>To prepare Cantonese rice, first rinse the rice under running water several times until the water is clear (this is a crucial step!), then let it drain on the colander. Cook the rice in plenty of lightly salted water (don&#8217;t overdo it because then the soy sauce will take care of it!) for 6 to 7 minutes and drain when al dente. Let the rice cool completely for about 20 to 30 minutes inside a large baking dish-it will reach the right consistency. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8815" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/05/photo5782690774620683312.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="834" /></p>
<blockquote><p>Ideally, cook the rice the day before and leave it in the refrigerator overnight-this step ensures the perfect texture of Cantonese rice once saut√©ed!</p></blockquote>
<p>Mix the Chinese wine, oyster sauce, and soy sauce in a small bowl and set aside (you can find all these ingredients in ethnic stores!) <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8816" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/05/photo5782690774620683313.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="1143" /> Boil the frozen peas for about 8 minutes, then drain and set aside; do the same thing with the shrimp for 5 minutes, if you got them frozen. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8817" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/05/photo5782690774620683315.jpg" alt="" width="866" height="960" /> In a nonstick skillet or wok, heat 1 tablespoon of seed oil, add the lightly beaten eggs with a pinch of salt, place over medium heat and stir with a whisk a few minutes, then set aside. In the same clean skillet with a sheet of paper towels heat 1 tablespoon of seed oil, add the thinly sliced spring onions and garlic powder, heat 1 minute, then add the cooked peas and shrimp and saute a few minutes.</p>

<a href='https://cookingwithtina.github.io//cantonese-fried-rice/photo5782690774620683314/#main'><img width="119" height="96" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/05/photo5782690774620683314.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" loading="lazy" /></a>
<a href='https://cookingwithtina.github.io//cantonese-fried-rice/photo5782690774620683317/#main'><img width="109" height="96" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/05/photo5782690774620683317.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" loading="lazy" /></a>

<p>Add the scrambled eggs, cold rice, and add the sauces, stir to coat the rice and cook over high heat for 2-3 minutes until the liquid evaporates, then turn off the heat. Finally add the cooked ham and let it mix for a few more seconds (the ham should not cook!). Add another tablespoon of oyster or soy sauce if desired! <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8820" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/05/photo5782690774620683319.jpg" alt="" width="1140" height="945" /> Here&#8217;s your <strong>Cantonese Rice </strong>ready, colorful and flavorful, serve it with the appropriate chopsticks, just Chinese style! <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8821" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/05/photo5782690774620683316.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="960" /></p>

This cake with the scent of oranges, maple syrup and almonds is made without any ingredients of animal origin, so without eggs, milk and butter, but it is nothing like my <a href="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//torta-camilla-con-carote-e-mandorle/">Camilla Cake</a>! It is really wholesome and perfect for the whole family, for breakfast or snack; ideal for people who are lactose intolerant, those who follow a vegan diet, those who are on a diet or simply those who love all the goodness of a healthy carrot cake!</p>
<ul>
<li>250 g raw carrots</li>
<li>150 gr organic whole wheat mixed cake flour (or mixed brown and rice flour)</li>
<li>50 gr of pearl and chopped almonds</li>
<li>50 gr potato starch</li>
<li>100 gr of brown sugar</li>
<li>150 ml lukewarm water (or soy or rice or oat milk)</li>
<li>150 ml orange juice</li>
<li>orange zest</li>
<li>two tablespoons of maple syrup (or agave syrup, or date syrup, which you can substitute with a teaspoon of vanilla essence)</li>
<li>150 ml of seed oil</li>
<li>grated peel of 1 orange</li>
<li>1 sachet of baking powder</li>
<li>1 pinch of salt</li>
<li>powdered sugar to complete</li>
</ul>
<p>First clean and peel the carrots, place them in a blender along with the orange peel and &#8216;seed oil and blend 5 &#8211; 6 minutes until you get a smooth cream (this is the secret to a super soft carrot cake!) <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8801" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/05/photo5765028292846533108.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="960" /> Mix the warm water, sugar, maple syrup and orange juice in a bowl; in a separate bowl mix the flour, starch, ground almonds, sugar, pinch of salt and baking powder <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8802" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/05/photo5765028292846533107.jpg" alt="" width="888" height="960" /></p>
<div class="wpurp-rows-row">Slowly add the flours with baking powder to the liquids, stirring with a spatula; then add the cream of carrots to the mixture, mixing the mixture well. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8803" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/05/photo5765028292846533106.jpg" alt="" width="1211" height="954" /> Pour the mixture into an oiled and floured 18- to 20-cm baking dish or lined with baking paper and bake in a preheated static oven at 180¬∞ for 40 minutes (it is always worth doing a toothpick test).
<a href='https://cookingwithtina.github.io//carrot-vegan-cake/photo5765028292846533105/#main'><img width="102" height="96" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/05/photo5765028292846533105.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" loading="lazy" /></a>
<a href='https://cookingwithtina.github.io//carrot-vegan-cake/photo5765028292846533219/#main'><img width="101" height="96" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/05/photo5765028292846533219.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" loading="lazy" /></a>
</p>
<p>Remove from the oven and let it cool at least 20 minutes before serving; you can present the Vegan Carrot Cake with a little maple syrup on top-a real treat! <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8806" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/05/photo5765028292846533222.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="960" /> <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8807" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/05/photo5765028292846533220.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="960" /></div>

They are sweet, yet full of wholesome, healthy nutrients, egg-free, dairy-free, and butter-free! The texture is amazing: every bite melts in your mouth. These brownies are super quick to make, just whisk together all the ingredients and you&#8217;re done!</p>
<blockquote><p>If you want to make a gluten-free version, instead of 00 flour you can use half almond flour and half rice or corn flour!</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>100 g dark chocolate chips</li>
<li>1 large, ripe avocado</li>
<li>2 ripe bananas</li>
<li>3 pitted dates</li>
<li>60 gr 00 flour (alternatively 30 gr whole wheat flour and 30 gr almond flour)</li>
<li>20 g cocoa powder</li>
<li>1 teaspoon baking powder for cakes</li>
<li></li>
<li>30 gr peanut butter (alternatively, chop roasted peanuts with a tablespoon of seed oil)</li>
<li>30 gr of brown sugar</li>
<li>half a teaspoon of salt</li>
<li>5/6 walnuts, or two tablespoons of hazelnuts of your choice</li>
</ul>
<p>Line a square or rectangular baking pan with baking paper. Blend together the avocado, bananas and dates in a blender and whisk until it forms a smooth mass. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8794" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/05/photo6034863710616532807.jpg" alt="" width="1032" height="960" /> Transfer everything to a large bowl, add the flour, cocoa, sugar, salt, peanut butter, maple or agave syrup or dates (all ingredients you can find in organic stores!) and baking powder and mix well; alternatively you can continue using the blender for a minute. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8796" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/05/photo6034863710616532809.jpg" alt="" width="1038" height="945" /> Finally add the chocolate chips and nuts (your choice) and mix with a spatula. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8795" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/05/photo6034863710616532813.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="960" /> Pour the mixture into the mold and bake for 45 minutes in a preheated oven at 180¬∞, until the top starts to brown and the inside is cooked (you can pierce it with a toothpick, it should come out wet, but without dripping batter).</p>

<p>Let it cool completely before removing it from the mold and cutting.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Colored Vol-au-vents are baskets made from several overlapping layers of puff pastry, brushed with egg and baked in the oven, then filled with soft pea cream and boiled quail eggs, or with mayonnaise, lumpfish eggs and smoked salmon. A must on holiday tables, beautiful to look at and easy to prepare, these canestrini are served as an appetizer or finger food, and can be stuffed in a variety of ways, from sweet to savory. The filling inside them is usually based on meat, fish, vegetables, cheese, and mushrooms; however, the dough from which the vol au vent are made has a neutral taste, which can also be combined with sweet preparations, with creams and fruit. With this filling made with peas, mayonnaise, salmon and eggs you will look great for a buffet with friends or for a family Holiday appetizer!</p>
<blockquote><p>The name &#8220;Vol au vent&#8221; comes from the fact that they are light enough to be carried &#8220;away on the wind.&#8221; Their origin is attributed to French chef Marie-Antoine Car√™me who allegedly substituted a heavy crust for the light dough. However, in Fran√ßois Marin&#8217;s 1739 cookbook &#8220;<i>Les Dons de Comus</i>,&#8221; which predates Antoine Car√™me&#8217;s birth, a sweet dessert called &#8220;wind pie&#8221; is mentioned.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"></sup></p></blockquote>
<div class="col-md-6">
<div class="c-recipe__list2 c-typo1--body1 --theme-light3--text-links-interact-orange2">
<p>Ingredients for 10 vol-au-vents:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 puff pastry disks</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="col-md-6 col-md-f40">
<div class="c-recipe__list2 c-typo1--body1 --theme-light3--text-links-interact-orange2">
<ul>
<li>1 egg for brushing</li>
<li>10 quail eggs</li>
<li>150 g frozen peas</li>
<li>2/3 basil leaves</li>
<li>4/5 slices of smoked salmon</li>
<li>mayonnaise to taste</li>
<li>5 lumpfish eggs</li>
<li>salt and pepper</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p>To prepare the filled vol-au-vents, roll out the first puff pastry and cut out disks with a pastry cutter; proceed with the second puff pastry as well. Place the resulting discs on a baking sheet lined with baking paper and brush them with egg, while cupping the center of the remaining discs with a smaller pastry cutter to create many crowns.</p>

<p>Prick the whole discs so that they do not swell excessively in baking, then lay the pierced discs on top of the large discs, 3 each, also &#8216;brushed with egg.</p>

<p>Bake in a preheated static oven at 200¬∫ for about 12 to 14 minutes; take out of the oven and let them cool completely. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8784" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/05/photo6012704488277784012.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="960" /></p>
<blockquote><p>If the bottom has risen a bit after baking, you can gently squish it down with a teaspoon!</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="ILfuVd"><span class="hgKElc">For the filling of the vol-au-vents, boil the peas in lightly salted water, then whisk them together with the basil, a teaspoon of oil, salt and pepper and a tablespoon of cooking water until creamy. For hard-boiled quail eggs, on the other hand, you need to boil them in water for 3-4 minutes from the time they first boil. </span></span> It&#8217;s time to fill your vol-au-vents: so use the pea cream and fill 5, then add one egg each and a sprinkling of oregano.</p>

<p>For salmon vol-au-vents, use mayonnaise, salmon and the lumpfish eggs.</p>

<blockquote><p>If you also want a dairy-free version, just use dark chocolate instead of milk chocolate (I recycled some Easter egg!</p></blockquote>
<p>Mix the flour, cocoa, sugar, baking powder and a pinch of salt in a bowl. Add the chocolate chips and mix well. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8770" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/04/photo5994480164651777430.jpg" alt="" width="999" height="951" /> Separately, melt the milk chocolate and mix with the oil, then heat the water a few minutes and pour everything into the chocolate bowl. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8771" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/04/photo5994480164651777432.jpg" alt="" width="807" height="798" /> Then pour the flours into the chocolate, stir with a whisk and wait for the mixture to cool and set at room temperature; you should get a moist but not sticky mixture. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8772" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/04/photo5994480164651777431.jpg" alt="" width="969" height="951" /> Scoop out balls of the mixture with your hands or with the ice cream scoop tool and place them on 2 baking sheets previously lined with parchment paper. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8776" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/04/photo5994480164651777433.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="1280" /> Bake the double chocolate cookies in a preheated static oven at 180¬∞ for 10 minutes.

<p>Fold the savory croissants back up, starting with the base: roll it on itself until you reach the tip of the triangle. Lay the newly made savory croissants on a baking sheet lined with baking paper; brush the surface with egg yolk or milk and sprinkle with a few sesame seeds. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8749" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/04/photo5972142022565411042.jpg" alt="" width="1242" height="939" /> Bake your Savory Croissants in a static oven at 200¬∞ for 15 to 18 minutes, then take them out of the oven and let them cool. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8750" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/04/photo5972142022565411057.jpg" alt="" width="1272" height="846" /> To make the <strong>Pizzette </strong>, prepare the tomato sauce by heating the oil, sauce, paste, salt and sugar for a few minutes, then let cool <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8752" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/04/photo5972142022565411045.jpg" alt="" width="933" height="834" /> Unroll a rectangular roll of puff pastry directly into a baking dish, cut with a knife along vertical and then horizontal strips to make about 2-inch squares; put a teaspoon of tomato sauce in the center, then close two corners in the middle and add oregano.</p>

With a well-sharpened knife carve a grid first all vertical strips, then all horizontal strips, so as to make squares.</p>

<p>Bake the appetizers in the middle part of a static oven preheated to 200¬∞ and let them bake for about 15 minutes, then take them out of the oven and let them cool out of the pan and serve.</p>

<td>Nutella Tiramisu is a delicious, simple and quick eggless variation of the classic Tiramisu; perfect for summer, ideal as an end-of-meal dessert for lunches, dinners, birthdays, but also for a tasty snack! Suitable for children and those who cannot eat raw eggs, this dessert really appeals to everyone! Serves 6/8 people</p>
<ul>
<li>300 gr of ladyfingers</li>
<li>about 80 gr of cold espresso coffee</li>
<li>500 gr of mascarpone cheese</li>
<li>200 gr fresh cold liquid cream from the refrigerator</li>
<li>2 tablespoons of sugar</li>
<li>200 gr of Nutella</li>
<li>2 tablespoons of sugar</li>
<li>2 tablespoons of bitter cocoa</li>
</ul>
<p>First make mocha coffee (at least 3 mokes for two people!) and let it cool inside a glass bowl. Prepare the mascarpone and Nutella cream: work the mascarpone with the sugar in a bowl with an electric whisk until creamy; also whip the fresh cream. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8740" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/04/photo5958763092064188186.jpg" alt="" width="1005" height="960" /> Add the Nutella to the mascarpone and process until smooth; add the whipped cream and mix until smooth and homogeneous.

</p>
<p>Cover an oven dish with a first layer of cream, then dip the ladyfingers in coffee and arrange the first layer. Top the soaked ladyfingers with a layer of mascarpone cream and level as much as possible; then continue by topping with another layer of coffee-soaked ladyfingers and a layer of mascarpone cream.

</p>
<p>Finally, top the tiramisu with the remaining cream and level as much as possible, finally cover with bitter cocoa; place the Nutella tiramisu back in the refrigerator for a few hours before bringing it to the table.</td>

</ul>
<p>Start the preparation by chopping the vegetables, onion, carrot and garlic, heat the oil in a large pot and saut√© for 5 minutes. Add the veal roast and brown it well on all sides, then deglaze with the wine. Adjust the salt and pepper and add the rosemary.
<a href='https://cookingwithtina.github.io//pot-roast-veal/photo5938082846008785530/#main'><img width="106" height="96" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/04/photo5938082846008785530.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" loading="lazy" /></a>

</p>
<p>After adding the white wine, turn the roast several times to give it flavor, then add the meat stock, lower the heat to low. Now cover the pot with a lid and let the veal roast cook for about an hour. After an hour has passed, remove the lid, raise the flame and let the cooking liquid evaporate a little.
<a href='https://cookingwithtina.github.io//pot-roast-veal/photo5938082846008785536/#main'><img width="105" height="96" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/04/photo5938082846008785536.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" loading="lazy" /></a>

</p>
<blockquote><p>To adjust with cooking time: calculate about 55-60 minutes for each pound of meat!</p></blockquote>
<p>After cooking, arrange the veal roast on a plate. Remove the rosemary sprig from the pot and whisk the cooking juices using a food processor; in this way, the whipped cooking juices serve as a sauce to accompany the veal roast, after cutting it into slices, which you can reheat at the time.

</p>
<p>Serve your veal roast with your favorite vegetables!</p>
<blockquote><p>If you want to get more out of the cooking juices, you need to whisk it all up, put it back in the pot and add a few ladles of water. Place back on the heat, add a tablespoon of flour, mixed in a small glass of water. In this way you will get more of the cooking juices, to serve the veal roast that you have cooked in the pot.</p></blockquote>

</li>
<li>
<div class="recipe-ingredient-item ingredient_font_size_small">1 glass of<span class="recipe-ingredient-name"> white wine </span></div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="recipe-ingredient-item ingredient_font_size_small">1/2 onion, chopped</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="recipe-ingredient-item ingredient_font_size_small">1 sprig of parsley</div>

<li>2-3 tablespoons <span class="recipe-ingredient-name"> Extra-virgin olive oil</span></li>
<li>butter and grated Grana Padano cheese for creaming</li>
</ul>
<p>Start the preparation of Risotto with Sausage and Zucchini from the <a href="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//brodo-di-carne/">meat stock</a>, which you can also use for other preparations, and keep it warm. In a large saucepan, saut√© the thinly sliced onion in the oil for 3 minutes, then add the sausage stripped of its casing and crumbled with a fork; let it season for a few minutes while keeping the flame fairly high and stirring with a spoon. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8725" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/04/photo5928999316595258899.jpg" alt="" width="1017" height="930" /> Add the rice and <span class="tooltip_termine tooltip_72" title="" data-original-title="Riscaldare un alimento solido fino a farlo colorire, senza aggiungere grassi o liquidi.">toast</span> it for 3-4 minutes over high heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon. Deglaze with the white wine and let it evaporate. At this point, add the zucchini previously cut into cubes or strips, adjust the salt and pepper, and season to taste. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8726" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/04/photo5928999316595258895.jpg" alt="" width="1101" height="945" /> Lower the heat and cook the rice by adding a few ladles of hot broth to cover the rice, let it cook and then add more broth a little at a time, only when the risotto begins to dry out. Cook the risotto for the time indicated, about 13 to 15 minutes. When it is almost cooked, turn up the heat in order to evaporate the excess broth, then season with parsley and more pepper and cream with butter and grated cheese. Serve piping hot and enjoy! <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8727" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/04/photo5928999316595258900.jpg" alt="" width="1054" height="948" /> <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8728" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/04/photo5928999316595258897.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="960" /></p>
