<p align="JUSTIFY"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8817" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2022/05/photo5782690774620683315.jpg" alt="" width="866" height="960" /></p>

This cake with the scent of oranges, maple syrup and almonds is made without any ingredients of animal origin, so without eggs, milk and butter, but it is nothing like my <a href="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//torta-camilla-con-carote-e-mandorle/">Camilla Cake</a>! It is really wholesome and perfect for the whole family, for breakfast or snack; ideal for people who are lactose intolerant, those who follow a vegan diet, those who are on a diet or simply those who love all the goodness of a healthy carrot cake!</p>
<ul>
<li>250 g raw carrots</li>
<li>150 gr organic whole wheat mixed cake flour (or mixed brown and rice flour)</li>
<li>50 gr of pearl and chopped almonds</li>
<li>50 gr potato starch</li>
<li>100 gr of brown sugar</li>
<li>150 ml lukewarm water (or soy or rice or oat milk)</li>
<li>150 ml orange juice</li>
<li>orange zest</li>
<li>two tablespoons of maple syrup (or agave syrup, or date syrup, which you can substitute with a teaspoon of vanilla essence)</li>
<li>150 ml of seed oil</li>
<li>grated peel of 1 orange</li>
<li>1 sachet of baking powder</li>
<li>1 pinch of salt</li>
<li>powdered sugar to complete</li>
</ul>
<p>First clean and peel the carrots, place them in a blender along with the orange peel and &#8216;seed oil and blend 5 &#8211; 6 minutes until you get a smooth cream (this is the secret to a super soft carrot cake!) <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8801" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2022/05/photo5765028292846533108.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="960" /> Mix the warm water, sugar, maple syrup and orange juice in a bowl; in a separate bowl mix the flour, starch, ground almonds, sugar, pinch of salt and baking powder <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8802" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2022/05/photo5765028292846533107.jpg" alt="" width="888" height="960" /></p>
<div class="wpurp-rows-row">Slowly add the flours with baking powder to the liquids, stirring with a spatula; then add the cream of carrots to the mixture, mixing the mixture well. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8803" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2022/05/photo5765028292846533106.jpg" alt="" width="1211" height="954" /> Pour the mixture into an oiled and floured 18- to 20-cm baking dish or lined with baking paper and bake in a preheated static oven at 180° for 40 minutes (it is always worth doing a toothpick test).

<a href='https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//carrot-vegan-cake/photo5765028292846533219/#main'><img width="101" height="96" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2022/05/photo5765028292846533219.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" loading="lazy" /></a>
</p>
<p>Remove from the oven and let it cool at least 20 minutes before serving; you can present the Vegan Carrot Cake with a little maple syrup on top-a real treat! <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8806" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2022/05/photo5765028292846533222.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="960" /> <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8807" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2022/05/photo5765028292846533220.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="960" /></div>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>My vegan avocado, banana and chocolate brownies are truly amazing, mouthwatering treats that are no match for classic brownies! They are made with simple ingredients such as banana, peanut butter, avocado, dates and maple syrup; all mixed with bitter cocoa and chocolate chips! They are sweet, yet full of wholesome, healthy nutrients, egg-free, dairy-free, and butter-free! The texture is amazing: every bite melts in your mouth. These brownies are super quick to make, just whisk together all the ingredients and you&#8217;re done! If you want to make a gluten-free version, instead of 00 flour you can use half almond flour&#8230;</p>

These brownies are super quick to make, just whisk together all the ingredients and you&#8217;re done!</p>
<blockquote><p>If you want to make a gluten-free version, instead of 00 flour you can use half almond flour and half rice or corn flour!</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>100 g dark chocolate chips</li>
<li>1 large, ripe avocado</li>
<li>2 ripe bananas</li>
<li>3 pitted dates</li>
<li>60 gr 00 flour (alternatively 30 gr whole wheat flour and 30 gr almond flour)</li>
<li>20 g cocoa powder</li>
<li>1 teaspoon baking powder for cakes</li>
<li></li>
<li>30 gr peanut butter (alternatively, chop roasted peanuts with a tablespoon of seed oil)</li>
<li>30 gr of brown sugar</li>
<li>half a teaspoon of salt</li>
<li>5/6 walnuts, or two tablespoons of hazelnuts of your choice</li>
</ul>
<p>Line a square or rectangular baking pan with baking paper. Blend together the avocado, bananas and dates in a blender and whisk until it forms a smooth mass. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8794" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2022/05/photo6034863710616532807.jpg" alt="" width="1032" height="960" /> Transfer everything to a large bowl, add the flour, cocoa, sugar, salt, peanut butter, maple or agave syrup or dates (all ingredients you can find in organic stores!) and baking powder and mix well; alternatively you can continue using the blender for a minute. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8796" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2022/05/photo6034863710616532809.jpg" alt="" width="1038" height="945" /> Finally add the chocolate chips and nuts (your choice) and mix with a spatula. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8795" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2022/05/photo6034863710616532813.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="960" /> Pour the mixture into the mold and bake for 45 minutes in a preheated oven at 180°, until the top starts to brown and the inside is cooked (you can pierce it with a toothpick, it should come out wet, but without dripping batter).</p>

<p>Let it cool completely before removing it from the mold and cutting. You can serve the vegan Brownies with maple or date syrup! <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8799" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2022/05/photo6034863710616532806.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="960" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Heat a grill well, add a little coarse salt and begin grilling the eggplant slices, for about 2 to 3 minutes on each side, or until the black stripes typical of well-grilled vegetables appear. As you grill, add a little more coarse salt to the grill.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, prepare the high-sided baking dish where you will put the eggplant: on the bottom put a little olive oil, a couple of mint leaves, a couple of pieces of fresh garlic, pepper.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1143" height="771" class="wp-image-7905" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2021/05/photo5818665171583874945.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lay the grilled eggplant slices in the marinade, so that they fill the bottom. Add on top of the eggplant layer some more oil, garlic, olives, pepper, and if you like a chili pepper too!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1173" height="843" class="wp-image-7906" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2021/05/photo5818665171583874947.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Intersperse with more eggplant, and proceed this way, in layers, until you run out of ingredients. Go ahead and abound with the &#8216;olive oil, then you will reuse it to season the pasta, nothing goes to waste in the kitchen! In the &#8216;last layer add olives, garlic and mint.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally let them marinate for at least 30 minutes before serving, even better if you let them sit in the fridge overnight! You can serve your mouthwatering eggplant cold as well!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can alternatively use a glass jar, always proceeding in layers, perfect for gifting eggplant to friends and family!</p>
