</ul>
<p>Start the preparation by chopping the vegetables, onion, carrot and garlic, heat the oil in a large pot and saut√© for 5 minutes. Add the veal roast and brown it well on all sides, then deglaze with the wine. Adjust the salt and pepper and add the rosemary.

</p>
<p>After adding the white wine, turn the roast several times to give it flavor, then add the meat stock, lower the heat to low. Now cover the pot with a lid and let the veal roast cook for about an hour. After an hour has passed, remove the lid, raise the flame and let the cooking liquid evaporate a little.

</p>
<blockquote><p>To adjust with cooking time: calculate about 55-60 minutes for each pound of meat!</p></blockquote>
<p>After cooking, arrange the veal roast on a plate. Remove the rosemary sprig from the pot and whisk the cooking juices using a food processor; in this way, the whipped cooking juices serve as a sauce to accompany the veal roast, after cutting it into slices, which you can reheat at the time.

</p>
<p>Serve your veal roast with your favorite vegetables!</p>
<blockquote><p>If you want to get more out of the cooking juices, you need to whisk it all up, put it back in the pot and add a few ladles of water. Place back on the heat, add a tablespoon of flour, mixed in a small glass of water. In this way you will get more of the cooking juices, to serve the veal roast that you have cooked in the pot.</p></blockquote>

</li>
<li>
<div class="recipe-ingredient-item ingredient_font_size_small">about 1 l of<span class="recipe-ingredient-name">previously prepared<a href="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//brodo-di-carne/"> meat broth</a> </span></div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="recipe-ingredient-item ingredient_font_size_small">1 glass of<span class="recipe-ingredient-name"> white wine </span></div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="recipe-ingredient-item ingredient_font_size_small">1/2 onion, chopped</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="recipe-ingredient-item ingredient_font_size_small">1 sprig of parsley</div>
</li>
<li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
<li>2-3 tablespoons <span class="recipe-ingredient-name"> Extra-virgin olive oil</span></li>
<li>butter and grated Grana Padano cheese for creaming</li>
</ul>
<p>Start the preparation of Risotto with Sausage and Zucchini from the <a href="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//brodo-di-carne/">meat stock</a>, which you can also use for other preparations, and keep it warm. In a large saucepan, saut√© the thinly sliced onion in the oil for 3 minutes, then add the sausage stripped of its casing and crumbled with a fork; let it season for a few minutes while keeping the flame fairly high and stirring with a spoon. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8725" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/04/photo5928999316595258899.jpg" alt="" width="1017" height="930" /> Add the rice and <span class="tooltip_termine tooltip_72" title="" data-original-title="Riscaldare un alimento solido fino a farlo colorire, senza aggiungere grassi o liquidi.">toast</span> it for 3-4 minutes over high heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon. Deglaze with the white wine and let it evaporate. At this point, add the zucchini previously cut into cubes or strips, adjust the salt and pepper, and season to taste. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8726" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/04/photo5928999316595258895.jpg" alt="" width="1101" height="945" /> Lower the heat and cook the rice by adding a few ladles of hot broth to cover the rice, let it cook and then add more broth a little at a time, only when the risotto begins to dry out. Cook the risotto for the time indicated, about 13 to 15 minutes. When it is almost cooked, turn up the heat in order to evaporate the excess broth, then season with parsley and more pepper and cream with butter and grated cheese. Serve piping hot and enjoy! <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8727" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/04/photo5928999316595258900.jpg" alt="" width="1054" height="948" /> <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8728" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/04/photo5928999316595258897.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="960" /></p>

<p>Meat cannelloni, stuffed with Bolognese pork ragout, b√©chamel sauce and Parmesan cheese, is a classic first course of the Italian tradition, rich and flavorful, perfect for any festive occasion, such as Christmas or Easter, or simply for Sunday lunch with the family. It is a dish made with squares of fresh dough: first they are filled with ground meat, then arranged in a baking dish, covered with tomato sauce, b√©chamel sauce, parmesan cheese and finally baked in the oven: a truly unique treat! You can conveniently prepare them the day before, store them in the refrigerator and bake them at the time, or bake them well in advance and reheat them for the occasion!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Doses for 6 large cannelloni:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>250 g package of ready-made lasagna (6 sheets)</li>
<li>300 gr of minced beef</li>
<li>150 gr of sausage</li>
<li>700 gr tomato sauce (350 gr for the meat sauce and 350 gr for the sauce)</li>
<li>2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil</li>
<li>100 gr of grated parmesan cheese</li>
<li>1 teaspoon of sugar</li>
<li>1/2 onion</li>
<li>1 small piece of celery</li>
<li>1 small piece of carrot</li>
<li>1/2 glass of wine (white or red of your choice)</li>
<li>300 ml meat stock</li>
<li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
<li>250 gr whole milk + 1 glass for the meat sauce</li>
<li>20 gr butter + 15 gr</li>
<li>20 gr of flour</li>
<li>salt</li>
<li>pepper</li>
<li>nutmeg to taste.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To prepare the cannelloni start with the <a href="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//ragu-di-carne/">meat sauce</a>: heat a tablespoon of oil in a large pot with chopped celery, carrot and onion, add chopped sausage (remove the casing) and beef and stew for 5-6 minutes. Deglaze with wine and stir, as soon as the alcohol has evaporated add 350 g of tomato puree and the beef stock, stir it all together. Season with salt and pepper and simmer with the lid on low heat for at least 2 hours. Add a glass of milk, open the lid a little and let it cook another hour, letting the meat sauce dry out well, then let it cool.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Prepare the sauce for seasoning, placing the remaining passata (350 g) on the stove with 2 to 3 tablespoons of water, a tablespoon of oil and cook 15 minutes, season with salt, also add sugar and set aside.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now prepare the <a href="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//besciamella/">b√©chamel sauce</a>: put the butter in a pan, melt it and then add the flour. Stir well with a whisk and then slowly add the milk, salt and nutmeg. Keep stirring until the cream thickens.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="951" height="915" class="wp-image-8632" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/02/photo5827705841518753791.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Take the ready lasagna sheets and blanch them one by one for a few seconds in a pot of lightly salted water. Lay the sheets on a kitchen towel and let them cool for a few seconds.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Even if it says &#8220;no cooking&#8221; on the lasagna package, I still recommend blanching them, so you&#8217;ll be able to seal the cannelloni well!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When all the ingredients are perfectly chilled you can proceed with the assembly: take a rectangle of pasta and stuff it with the meat sauce and a sprinkling of Parmesan cheese on one side only, leaving a couple of cm from the edge on the wide side; then roll the sheet of pasta on itself. Seal the dough to form cylinders.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pour 1 ladleful of sauce and meat sauce into a large baking dish, place all the pasta cylinders back into the dish; top with tomato sauce, soft b√©chamel sauce ( if you have prepared it) finally with Parmesan cheese and 15 g of chopped butter.</p>

<p>Meatballs are a tasty, quick and easy dish of Italian tradition, prepared in many ways, depending on the location and the ingredients available. The only common element is the use of ground meat, which can belong to different cuts and animals; to this is usually added some wet stale bread or mashed boiled potatoes, and eggs; they are then lightly fried and given flavor in a good sauce, or cooked in a pan or in the oven. In this recipe I used four kinds of meat (veal, chicken, beef and pork), did not add soaked bread but a potato, and cooked them in a pan with white wine. Amazing result! Try my recipe for the four mince meatballs, your children and others will surely love it! If you have leftover broth meat, also try my recipe for <a href="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//polpettine-di-lesso/">boiled meatballs! </a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Doses for 55 meatballs of about 20 gr</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>200 gr ground veal meat</li>
<li>200 gr mixed ground beef and pork</li>
<li>300 gr ground chicken meat</li>
<li>one medium egg</li>
<li>one medium boiled potato</li>
<li>a teaspoon of garlic powder or a clove of minced garlic</li>
<li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
<li>a sprig of chopped parsley</li>
<li>Breadcrumbs to taste</li>
<li>1/2 glass of white wine</li>
<li>olive oil or seed oil to taste.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To prepare the meatballs, start by making the dough: in a large bowl put the ground meat, egg, boiled and mashed potato, salt, pepper, garlic and chopped parsley.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="924" height="890" class="wp-image-8200" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2021/09/photo5945178986680268838.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mix the ingredients to make a smooth dough, then form into many patties of about 20-22 g each.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1260" height="924" class="wp-image-8202" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2021/09/photo5945178986680268839.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Coat all the patties in breadcrumbs arranged in a small plate and refrigerate until ready to cook (you can prepare them the day before, too!)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1227" height="924" class="wp-image-8201" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2021/09/photo5945178986680268840.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To cook the patties: heat two tablespoons of olive oil in a large skillet and arrange the patties spaced apart, cook over medium-high heat two minutes on one side and two minutes on the other side, then lower the heat and deglaze with white wine. Cover with the lid and cook another 5 to 6 minutes, then turn them over and cook another 5 minutes.</p>

<p>Remove the lid, raise the flame and let it evaporate until cooked.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Serve your patties with your favorite sauces and a side of fresh or cooked vegetables or some chips!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>If you prefer, you can also fry your patties: so use a deep fryer and bring the frying oil to a temperature that does not exceed 170-180¬∞. When it is hot enough, dip 2-3 meatballs at a time so that the oil temperature does not drop too low, cook for a few minutes (2-3 minutes will be enough) until nicely browned, then transfer the cooked meatballs to paper towels just long enough to wipe off the excess oil.</p>

<p>Queen&#8217;s English Cake (in Italy called &#8220;Zuppa inglese&#8221;) is an Italian spoon dessert made with tasty ladyfingers (or sponge cake) soaked in alchermes and alternating layers of cocoa and vanilla custard. Well known in Italy, it is most popular in Emilia-Romagna, Lazio, Marche, Tuscany, Umbria and in Abruzzo. In each region some small variations to the basic recipe differentiate it significantly. The zuppa inglese is a very simple dessert to make but, thanks to the overlapping of various ingredients of different colors, it has a great scenic effect; I &#8216;prepared it on the occasion of my mother&#8217;s birthday, which this year falls on Easter Day, and for this I called it and decorated it with a wreath and chocolate eggs &#8230; a truly original and delicious gift!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>500 gr of whole milk</li>
<li>100 gr of fresh liquid cream</li>
<li>5 yolks</li>
<li>60 gr of cornstarch (cornflour)</li>
<li>120 gr of sugar</li>
<li>vanilla flavoring</li>
<li>60 gr of dark chocolate</li>
<li>250 gr of Alchermes</li>
<li>300 gr of ladyfingers + 50 for decoration</li>
<li>bitter cocoa powder q.b.</li>
<li>to decorate: sugar paste and decorations, chocolate eggs</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Prepare the custard for your zuppa inglese, you can make it with the Bimby: just put all the ingredients in the mug (so milk, cream, egg yolks, vanillin, sugar and cornstarch) and operate 7 minutes at 90¬∞, speed 4. Alternatively you can use a nonstick saucepan, pour in milk, vanilla and cream and heat letting it come close to a boil, separately beat the yolks with the sugar in a bowl, then add the cornstarch, stirring with a whisk to prevent lumps from forming. Now pour the eggs into the pot of milk and, stirring with a whisk, cook and thicken the cream.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Divide the cream into two bowls and in one add the chopped chocolate, then stir to melt it; let the two creams cool.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1218" height="921" class="wp-image-7753" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2021/04/photo5999107008365704671.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>At this point you can compose the dessert: soak the ladyfingers in &#8216;alchermes and arrange a first layer of ladyfingers in the bottom of a serving dish, bordered by an opening circle (alternatively you can use a glass baking dish).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="960" class="wp-image-7754" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2021/04/photo5999107008365704664.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Top with the cocoa cream, which you are going to spread over the entire layer of ladyfingers, then cover with another layer of ladyfingers soaked in alchermes, add the layer of light custard. Finally top with a final layer of ladyfingers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="888" height="948" class="wp-image-7755" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2021/04/photo5999107008365704668.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dust with bitter cocoa and chill in the refrigerator for at least two hours, then gently remove the rim and add ladyfingers all over the edge. Finally decorate with sugar paste (which I cut out in the shape of a wreath and sprinkled with brown sugar!) and chocolate eggs. Store in the refrigerator and serve.</p>
