This cake with the scent of oranges, maple syrup and almonds is made without any ingredients of animal origin, so without eggs, milk and butter, but it is nothing like my <a href="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//torta-camilla-con-carote-e-mandorle/">Camilla Cake</a>! It is really wholesome and perfect for the whole family, for breakfast or snack; ideal for people who are lactose intolerant, those who follow a vegan diet, those who are on a diet or simply those who love all the goodness of a healthy carrot cake!</p>
<ul>
<li>250 g raw carrots</li>
<li>150 gr organic whole wheat mixed cake flour (or mixed brown and rice flour)</li>
<li>50 gr of pearl and chopped almonds</li>
<li>50 gr potato starch</li>
<li>100 gr of brown sugar</li>
<li>150 ml lukewarm water (or soy or rice or oat milk)</li>
<li>150 ml orange juice</li>
<li>orange zest</li>
<li>two tablespoons of maple syrup (or agave syrup, or date syrup, which you can substitute with a teaspoon of vanilla essence)</li>
<li>150 ml of seed oil</li>
<li>grated peel of 1 orange</li>
<li>1 sachet of baking powder</li>
<li>1 pinch of salt</li>
<li>powdered sugar to complete</li>
</ul>
<p>First clean and peel the carrots, place them in a blender along with the orange peel and &#8216;seed oil and blend 5 &#8211; 6 minutes until you get a smooth cream (this is the secret to a super soft carrot cake!) <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8801" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/05/photo5765028292846533108.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="960" /> Mix the warm water, sugar, maple syrup and orange juice in a bowl; in a separate bowl mix the flour, starch, ground almonds, sugar, pinch of salt and baking powder <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8802" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/05/photo5765028292846533107.jpg" alt="" width="888" height="960" /></p>
<div class="wpurp-rows-row">Slowly add the flours with baking powder to the liquids, stirring with a spatula; then add the cream of carrots to the mixture, mixing the mixture well. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8803" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/05/photo5765028292846533106.jpg" alt="" width="1211" height="954" /> Pour the mixture into an oiled and floured 18- to 20-cm baking dish or lined with baking paper and bake in a preheated static oven at 180Â° for 40 minutes (it is always worth doing a toothpick test).
<a href='https://cookingwithtina.github.io//carrot-vegan-cake/photo5765028292846533105/#main'><img width="102" height="96" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/05/photo5765028292846533105.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" loading="lazy" /></a>

</p>
<p>Remove from the oven and let it cool at least 20 minutes before serving; you can present the Vegan Carrot Cake with a little maple syrup on top-a real treat! <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8806" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/05/photo5765028292846533222.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="960" /> <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8807" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/05/photo5765028292846533220.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="960" /></div>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>My vegan avocado, banana and chocolate brownies are truly amazing, mouthwatering treats that are no match for classic brownies! They are made with simple ingredients such as banana, peanut butter, avocado, dates and maple syrup; all mixed with bitter cocoa and chocolate chips! They are sweet, yet full of wholesome, healthy nutrients, egg-free, dairy-free, and butter-free! The texture is amazing: every bite melts in your mouth. These brownies are super quick to make, just whisk together all the ingredients and you&#8217;re done! If you want to make a gluten-free version, instead of 00 flour you can use half almond flour&#8230;</p>

They are made with simple ingredients such as banana, peanut butter, avocado, dates and maple syrup; all mixed with bitter cocoa and chocolate chips! They are sweet, yet full of wholesome, healthy nutrients, egg-free, dairy-free, and butter-free! The texture is amazing: every bite melts in your mouth. These brownies are super quick to make, just whisk together all the ingredients and you&#8217;re done!</p>
<blockquote><p>If you want to make a gluten-free version, instead of 00 flour you can use half almond flour and half rice or corn flour!</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>100 g dark chocolate chips</li>
<li>1 large, ripe avocado</li>
<li>2 ripe bananas</li>
<li>3 pitted dates</li>
<li>60 gr 00 flour (alternatively 30 gr whole wheat flour and 30 gr almond flour)</li>
<li>20 g cocoa powder</li>
<li>1 teaspoon baking powder for cakes</li>
<li></li>
<li>30 gr peanut butter (alternatively, chop roasted peanuts with a tablespoon of seed oil)</li>
<li>30 gr of brown sugar</li>
<li>half a teaspoon of salt</li>
<li>5/6 walnuts, or two tablespoons of hazelnuts of your choice</li>
</ul>
<p>Line a square or rectangular baking pan with baking paper. Blend together the avocado, bananas and dates in a blender and whisk until it forms a smooth mass. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8794" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/05/photo6034863710616532807.jpg" alt="" width="1032" height="960" /> Transfer everything to a large bowl, add the flour, cocoa, sugar, salt, peanut butter, maple or agave syrup or dates (all ingredients you can find in organic stores!) and baking powder and mix well; alternatively you can continue using the blender for a minute. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8796" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/05/photo6034863710616532809.jpg" alt="" width="1038" height="945" /> Finally add the chocolate chips and nuts (your choice) and mix with a spatula. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8795" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/05/photo6034863710616532813.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="960" /> Pour the mixture into the mold and bake for 45 minutes in a preheated oven at 180Â°, until the top starts to brown and the inside is cooked (you can pierce it with a toothpick, it should come out wet, but without dripping batter).</p>

<a href='https://cookingwithtina.github.io//vegan-brownies-with-avocado-banana-and-dark-chocolate/photo6034863710616532815/#main'><img width="118" height="96" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/05/photo6034863710616532815.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" loading="lazy" /></a>

<p>Let it cool completely before removing it from the mold and cutting. You can serve the vegan Brownies with maple or date syrup! <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8799" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/05/photo6034863710616532806.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="960" /></p>

<ul>
<li>200 gr of flour &#8217;00</li>
<li>30 gr of bitter cocoa</li>
<li>60 ml seed oil</li>
<li>100 gr milk chocolate</li>
<li>100 ml hot water</li>
<li>80 gr of brown sugar or classic sugar</li>
<li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
<li>80 gr of dark chocolate chips</li>
<li>salt to taste</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>If you also want a dairy-free version, just use dark chocolate instead of milk chocolate (I recycled some Easter egg!</p></blockquote>
<p>Mix the flour, cocoa, sugar, baking powder and a pinch of salt in a bowl. Add the chocolate chips and mix well. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8770" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/04/photo5994480164651777430.jpg" alt="" width="999" height="951" /> Separately, melt the milk chocolate and mix with the oil, then heat the water a few minutes and pour everything into the chocolate bowl. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8771" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/04/photo5994480164651777432.jpg" alt="" width="807" height="798" /> Then pour the flours into the chocolate, stir with a whisk and wait for the mixture to cool and set at room temperature; you should get a moist but not sticky mixture. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8772" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/04/photo5994480164651777431.jpg" alt="" width="969" height="951" /> Scoop out balls of the mixture with your hands or with the ice cream scoop tool and place them on 2 baking sheets previously lined with parchment paper. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8776" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/04/photo5994480164651777433.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="1280" /> Bake the double chocolate cookies in a preheated static oven at 180Â° for 10 minutes. Then let them cool to room temperature before enjoying. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8774" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/04/photo5994480164651777428-1.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="960" /> <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8775" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/04/photo5994480164651777429.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="960" /></p>

<td>Nutella Tiramisu is a delicious, simple and quick eggless variation of the classic Tiramisu; perfect for summer, ideal as an end-of-meal dessert for lunches, dinners, birthdays, but also for a tasty snack! Suitable for children and those who cannot eat raw eggs, this dessert really appeals to everyone! Serves 6/8 people</p>
<ul>
<li>300 gr of ladyfingers</li>
<li>about 80 gr of cold espresso coffee</li>
<li>500 gr of mascarpone cheese</li>
<li>200 gr fresh cold liquid cream from the refrigerator</li>
<li>2 tablespoons of sugar</li>
<li>200 gr of Nutella</li>
<li>2 tablespoons of sugar</li>
<li>2 tablespoons of bitter cocoa</li>
</ul>
<p>First make mocha coffee (at least 3 mokes for two people!) and let it cool inside a glass bowl. Prepare the mascarpone and Nutella cream: work the mascarpone with the sugar in a bowl with an electric whisk until creamy; also whip the fresh cream. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8740" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/04/photo5958763092064188186.jpg" alt="" width="1005" height="960" /> Add the Nutella to the mascarpone and process until smooth; add the whipped cream and mix until smooth and homogeneous.

</p>
<p>Cover an oven dish with a first layer of cream, then dip the ladyfingers in coffee and arrange the first layer. Top the soaked ladyfingers with a layer of mascarpone cream and level as much as possible; then continue by topping with another layer of coffee-soaked ladyfingers and a layer of mascarpone cream.
<a href='https://cookingwithtina.github.io//nutella-tiramisu-no-eggs-second-version/photo5958763092064188184/#main'><img width="118" height="96" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/04/photo5958763092064188184.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" loading="lazy" /></a>

</p>
<p>Finally, top the tiramisu with the remaining cream and level as much as possible, finally cover with bitter cocoa; place the Nutella tiramisu back in the refrigerator for a few hours before bringing it to the table.</td>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Doses for about 26 cookies:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>220 gr 00 flour</li>
<li>100 gr of butter</li>
<li>100 gr sugar</li>
<li>1 egg</li>
<li>1 sachet of vanillin</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder for cakes</li>
<li>a pinch of salt</li>
<li>150 g Nutella</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Prepare the shortcrust pastry by mixing with your hands the flour, sugar, baking powder, vanillin, salt, chopped cold butter, then the egg until you obtain a compact and homogeneous mixture; leave in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Roll out the resulting shortcrust pastry with a rolling pin, on a lightly floured sheet of baking paper, until you obtain a square that is as symmetrical as possible, then spread Nutella over the pastry, reaching to the edges on one side, but leaving some free space above and below on the other.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once you are done, roll up from the longest side, wrap the roll in baking paper and put it to firm up in the freezer for at least an &#8216;hour.</p>

<p>Ox-eye cookies are delicious and simple shortbread treats filled with jam or <a href="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//nutella-fatta-in-casa-con-e-senza-bimby/">Nutella</a>. Ideal to serve for breakfast or as a snack with tea, these cookies with a soft and creamy filling are made by overlapping two round cookies, one of which has a hole in the center, and are called &#8220;bull&#8217;s eyes&#8221; because their rounded shape is reminiscent of a cooked fried bull&#8217;s eye egg!

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Doses for 10 large cookies:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>1 egg</li>
<li>200 gr flour</li>
<li>100 gr butter at room temperature</li>
<li>100 gr powdered sugar</li>
<li>a sachet of vanillin</li>
<li>a teaspoon of baking powder</li>
<li>a pinch of salt</li>
<li>100 gr about 100 gr Nutella</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a bowl, mix together the softened butter, egg and sugar. Then add the sifted flour, vanillin, salt and baking powder. Knead until you make a smooth dough ball. Cover it with plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for half an hour.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-container-6 wp-block-gallery-5 wp-block-gallery columns-2 is-cropped">
<ul class="blocks-gallery-grid">

<figure><img loading="lazy" width="912" height="921" class="wp-image-8609" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/02/photo5805151082756814964.jpg" alt="" data-id="8609" data-link="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//?attachment_id=8609#main" /></figure>

</li>
</ul>
</figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>After the specified time has elapsed, lightly dust a pastry board with flour, take the shortcrust pastry and roll it out with the help of a rolling pin: you should obtain a sheet about half an inch thick. Remember that the sheet of dough must be cold before forming the cookies, otherwise they will come in less than perfect shapes! In case you feel it is soft , place it back in the refrigerator on a cutting board for 15 minutes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then take half the dough, with a round mold (even a glass) form 10 circles and place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. With the leftover dough, roll out another sheet of dough and make 10 more disks of the same diameter, which you will pierce in the center with a smaller form.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

</li>
</ul>
</figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Place these cookies on the drip pan as well and bake in a preheated oven at 180Â°, for 10 minutes. As soon as the surface is golden brown, take them out of the oven and let them cool.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

</li>
</ul>
</figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now take the whole disks and spread Nutella on top, finally top with the perforated cookies. Before serving dust them with powdered sugar. Your bull&#8217;s eye cookies are ready to be enjoyed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Fortune cookies are crunchy treats, of Japanese origin, very simple and original: they are crescent-shaped cookies, flavored with vanilla, made with egg whites, sugar, oil, flour and vanillin, inside of which is enclosed a message, usually prophetic or even divinatory phrases, but it can also be personalized! Their preparation is very simple, but care must be taken not to overcook them, or undercook them, and once they are baked, when quickly the leaflet should be inserted and the cookie folded and set aside to cool. Try making homemade fortune cookies to surprise friends at the end of a special evening, or personalize them to make a truly original Valentine&#8217;s Day gift!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ingredients for about 14 cookies:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>75 g egg whites</li>
<li>110 gr of sugar</li>
<li>90 gr of 00 flour</li>
<li>20 gr of cornstarch</li>
<li>15 gr melted butter or extra virgin olive oil</li>
<li>one sachet vanillin</li>
<li>2 tablespoons of water</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To prepare the fortune cookies recipe, before you start write the messages that will go inside the cookies, cutting out small strips of light paper; I wrote phrases to dedicate to my husband, for Valentine&#8217;s Day!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>First prepare the dough: pour the egg whites and sugar into a bowl and beat with a whisk to combine them, but without whipping them to stiff peaks. Add the melted butter or oil, vanillin, 00 flour and sifted cornstarch.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1044" height="927" class="wp-image-8582" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/02/photo5785005826417735899.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mix well, again with a kitchen whisk, then add a couple of tablespoons of water until you have a creamy mixture, a rather thick batter.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="963" height="960" class="wp-image-8583" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/02/photo5785005826417735898.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cover a baking sheet with baking paper and draw circles using a glass about 7/8 cm in diameter, spacing them slightly apart.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Take a generous teaspoon of the mixture, place it in the center of a circle on the baking paper and with the back of the teaspoon expand it in circular motions until the circle is filled. You will need to get a thin layer. Since fortune cookies should be closed and folded while they are still warm, bake them three/four at a time so you have plenty of time to proceed with the folding.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1208" height="891" class="wp-image-8584" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/02/photo5785005826417735902.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bake and bake for 7 to 8 minutes in a static oven preheated to 175Â°; do not bake them longer or they will be too hard and you will not be able to fold them and they will all break (as happened to me, lucky I had more dough!!)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1246" height="868" class="wp-image-8585" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/02/photo5785005826417735901.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once they are baked, turn them upside down so that the side in contact with the plate becomes the inside of the cookie, lay a small card in the center of each with your favorite message, close it in a crescent shape and fold the two tips down (gently and being careful not to break them).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Use the rim of a glass or with the rim of a cup to give the cookies their characteristic shape by folding them over and bringing the ends closer together</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-container-14 wp-block-gallery-13 wp-block-gallery columns-2 is-cropped">

</li>
</ul>
</figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Place the cookies thus formed inside a muffin mold and let them cool so that they keep their shape. Once cooled, your fortune cookies are ready to be enjoyed, and how satisfying!</p>

And for a truly complete Carnival buffet, try my recipe for <a href="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//castagnole-fritte-neutre-e-alla-nutella/">Fried Castagnole</a>, too!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ingredients for 22 bugias:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>50 gr Butter at room temperature</li>
<li>200 gr Flour 00</li>
<li>50 ml White wine (or grappa, or anise or strega liqueur)</li>
<li>30 gr Sugar</li>
<li>1 whole egg</li>
<li>1 lemon peel</li>
<li>1 pinch of Salt</li>
<li>a teaspoon of baking powder for cakes</li>
<li>a sachet of vanillin</li>
<li>200 g Nutella</li>
<li>Seed oil for frying</li>
<li>Powdered sugar to taste.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Place the flour, egg, softened butter, sugar, pinch of salt, wine, grated lemon zest and baking powder in a large bowl; start kneading with your hands.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once the mixture has become smooth and nonsticky, form it into a ball, cover it with plastic wrap and place it to rest in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

</ul>
</figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once the resting time has passed, take the dough, divide it into 3 parts and roll it out, one at a time, with a rolling pin (or pasta machine) into a 3/4 mm thin sheet, on a well-floured work surface; fold the sheet over itself a couple of times and roll it out again, this way it will fill with bubbles in baking!</p>

</li>
</ul>
</figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once the dough is rolled out, add the filling: 1 teaspoon of Nutella about 3 cm apart</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1269" height="603" class="wp-image-8560" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/02/photo6050711697557142007.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Brush the edges of the filling with water, close the lies and carve the outlines as if to make ravioli. With these doses you will get 22 bugie (I had leftover dough and also made 2 galani!)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Heat a small pan with plenty of seed oil to a temperature of 170Â°. Fry a few pieces at a time, turning after a few seconds! The stuffed lies will puff up immediately! Just a few seconds and you can drain them on a plate lined with paper towels.</p>

<p>Immediately place the stuffed lies in a serving dish and sprinkle with powdered sugar, serve immediately or store them in a paper bag for a couple of days!</p>

<p>Chiacchiere are crispy and delicious treats that are prepared during the Carnival period; very crumbly, made by thinly rolling out a simple dough made of flour, eggs, butter and white wine or grappa, then fried and sprinkled with powdered sugar. They have a typical rectangular shape, with two clean cuts in the middle, are quick and easy to make, and with their aroma it&#8217;s a party right away!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Chiacchere are known throughout Italy but have many regional variations that are evident not only in the ingredients and preparation, but starting with the name itself: in Lazio they are often called <em>Frappe</em>, in Tuscany <em>Cenci</em> or <em>Donzelle</em>, in Sicily <em>chiacchiere</em>, <em>frappe</em> in Lazio, <em>bugie</em> in Piedmont and Liguria, <em>Sfrappole</em> in Emilia, <em>CrÃ²stoli</em> in Trentino and <em>Galani or Gale </em>in Veneto!</p>

<li>one sachet of vanillin</li>

</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then with a jagged wheel cut medium-sized rectangles from the pastry sheet and in the center make two parallel cuts on the side of the longest side of the rectangle; place the rectangles, spaced so that they do not stick together, on lightly floured cutting boards or serving plates.</p>
