You can use this tasty sauce to create tempting appetizers, or add flavor to sandwiches and sandwiches as well.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Serves 4:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>300 g of <a href="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//maionese-fatta-in-casa/">Mayonnaise</a></li>
<li>80 g of Ketchup</li>
<li>1 tablespoon of Worcestershire Sauce</li>
<li>1 tablespoon Cognac or Brandy or 2 tablespoons white wine</li>
<li>1 teaspoon of Mustard (optional)</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>First make homemade mayonnaise following <a href="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//maionese-fatta-in-casa/">this recipe</a>, or buy it already made!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Put the mayonnaise in a bowl and add the ketchup, cognac or brandy or wine and worcestershire sauce and mix well with a spoon so that a smooth sauce forms.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you want to make the rose sauce with fresh cooking cream, here&#8217;s how to do it: lightly whip the cream in a bowl. In another bowl mix all the other ingredients, as per the recipe, and add the cream to the mixture. For a lighter preparation you can substitute the cream with low-fat yogurt or Greek yogurt, eliminating the mustard.</p>

<p>Omelets are a typical French egg dish, soft pancakes similar to <a href="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//crepes-dolci/">Crepes</a> but with a different composition of ingredients; with one characteristic: they are cooked in a pan on one side only, then folded into a crescent shape. Omelets can be sweet or savory, filled with mixed cold cuts, vegetables or cheese, or with jam and Nutella for the sweet version. Great both for breakfast and for a quick, original and light dinner!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Servings for one large omelet or two omelets:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>4 eggs</li>
<li>60 ml whole milk</li>
<li>salt to taste</li>
<li>a drizzle of oil for cooking</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To prepare the omelets first, break the eggs into a bowl, add the milk and a pinch of salt. Beat the eggs using a whisk until completely mixed with the milk.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

</li>
</ul>
</figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Heat a pan (20 cm in diameter if you are making two, or larger for a single one) on the stove and add a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, then turn the pan to distribute it over the entire surface; pour the egg mixture inside and cook the omelet over a slow flame: as soon as it starts to congeal on the edges (after one minute) cover with a lid.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

</li>
</ul>
</figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rotate the pan gently to prevent the omelet from staying on the same spot for too long.; as soon as the omelet is soft on the surface (after about 2 minutes) fold the omelet with a nonstick crescent-shaped paddle, wait a few seconds longer in the pan and serve your omelet piping hot.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>In France it is customary to sprinkle flakes of butter over the omelette while it is still nice and hot-they will melt easily and help keep the preparation soft!</p>
<p>Once ready make delicious savory omelets: ham and cheese, baked or pan-fried seasonal vegetables, philpadephia, yogurt, stracchino cheese, mixed salad.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can make a sweet Omelette with fresh seasonal fruit and 2 tablespoons of jam or a cream of your choice, Nutella, peanut butter, a sprinkling of powdered sugar or coconut, pistachio or hazelnut granola.</p>

<p>Lobster is a highly prized crustacean, caught in the Atlantic Sea and in some parts of the Mediterranean, with which you can cook many fine dishes and many recipes with a strong flavor: tasty main courses, seafood grills with prawns, delicate appetizers, and gourmet restaurant first courses!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Lobster and Lobster are similar, but they are not the same thing: the lobster belongs to the <em>astacid</em> family and gets to measure 30 to 40 cm; the lobster falls under the <em>palinuri</em> order and on average measures 20 to 40 cm. The European lobster species can be distinguished from the American lobster by the color of its shell, which tends to be blue and light-bellied, while the latter has a bright red shell.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this recipe I propose boiled lobster, a simple and easy way to cook this crustacean, perfect as a menu for a feast day; whole by half a kilo if you serve it as a main course, or half if it will be an appetizer!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Serves 2 to 3 people:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>3 lobsters</li>
<li>one onion</li>
<li>a stalk of celery</li>
<li>a sprig of parsley</li>
<li>one carrot</li>
<li>a bay leaf</li>
<li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
<li>extra virgin olive oil, a teaspoon of mustard, juice of half a lemon, parsley, salt and pepper for seasoning (optional)</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For this recipe I used <strong>frozen lobster</strong>, which I thawed for a few hours in the refrigerator (even overnight), or you can soak it in a saucepan full of warm water for 30 minutes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="836" height="888" class="wp-image-7014" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2020/12/photo6012370477261107905.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once thawed, wash it under running water, then scrub the carapace and underside well using a toothbrush to remove any residual sand.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Prepare the <strong>vegetable broth</strong> in which you will cook your lobsters: in a large pot add all the vegetables, salt, pepper and parsley and simmer for 30 to 40 minutes, then submerge the lobsters and let them cook for about 10 to 12 minutes (they will turn a nice bright red color, you have to calculate <em>about 20 minutes for each kg</em> of weight). Turn off and let them rest a few more minutes in the cooking water, then drain and let them cool.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-container-10 wp-block-gallery-9 wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped">
<ul class="blocks-gallery-grid">
<li class="blocks-gallery-item">
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="772" height="794" class="wp-image-7015" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2020/12/photo6012370477261107906.jpg" alt="" data-id="7015" data-link="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//?attachment_id=7015#main" /></figure>
</li>
<li class="blocks-gallery-item">
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="682" height="762" class="wp-image-7017" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2020/12/photo6012370477261107909.jpg" alt="" data-id="7017" data-full-url="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2020/12/photo6012370477261107909.jpg" data-link="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//?attachment_id=7017#main" /></figure>
</li>
</ul>
</figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can serve the lobsters whole or cleaned: then remove the head by twisting it with a sharp, sharp blow (which you can use for a fish stock or fumet!); cut off the shell with a chicken cutter lengthwise, starting from the tail and cutting through both the abdomen and the back, and gently extract the flesh. Finally, break the claws with a nutcracker or a meat pounder and extract the flesh with a long, thin fork.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="970" height="924" class="wp-image-7018" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2020/12/photo6012370477261107908.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can season the flesh with a pinzimonio made with Evo oil, mustard, salt, pepper, parsley and lemon juice. Serve the lobsters with lemon slices and mayonnaise or pink sauce, or béarnaise sauce, always being careful not to use flavors that are too strong, so as not to overpower the delicate taste of the crustacean.</p>
