										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cantonese Rice is the best-known recipe in Chinese cuisine, along with <a href="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//ravioli-cinesi-al-vapore/">steamed dumplings, </a> spring rolls, and chicken with almonds! This recipe is based on basmati rice first boiled (best the day before!) and then stir-fried in a pan or Wok with scrambled eggs, peas, ham and gaberetti! A simple, quick, tasty and colorful dish, the whole family likes it and the kids love it! Prepare Cantonese rice and serve it with the famous chopsticks, just Chinese style! Ingredients for two/three people:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 tablespoon Chinese wine</li>
<li>1 tablespoon oyster sauce</li>
<li>2 tablespoons of soy sauce</li>
<li>2 tablespoons seed oil</li>
<li>2 spring onions</li>
<li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
<li>200 g basmati or Jasmine rice</li>
<li>2 eggs</li>
<li>150 g frozen peas</li>
<li>150 gr fresh or frozen shrimps</li>
<li>150 gr diced cooked ham</li>
<li>salt to taste.</li>
</ul>
<p>To prepare Cantonese rice, first rinse the rice under running water several times until the water is clear (this is a crucial step!), then let it drain on the colander. Cook the rice in plenty of lightly salted water (don&#8217;t overdo it because then the soy sauce will take care of it!) for 6 to 7 minutes and drain when al dente. Let the rice cool completely for about 20 to 30 minutes inside a large baking dish-it will reach the right consistency. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8815" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/05/photo5782690774620683312.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="834" /></p>
<blockquote><p>Ideally, cook the rice the day before and leave it in the refrigerator overnight-this step ensures the perfect texture of Cantonese rice once saut√©ed!</p></blockquote>
<p>Mix the Chinese wine, oyster sauce, and soy sauce in a small bowl and set aside (you can find all these ingredients in ethnic stores!) <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8816" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/05/photo5782690774620683313.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="1143" /> Boil the frozen peas for about 8 minutes, then drain and set aside; do the same thing with the shrimp for 5 minutes, if you got them frozen. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8817" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/05/photo5782690774620683315.jpg" alt="" width="866" height="960" /> In a nonstick skillet or wok, heat 1 tablespoon of seed oil, add the lightly beaten eggs with a pinch of salt, place over medium heat and stir with a whisk a few minutes, then set aside. In the same clean skillet with a sheet of paper towels heat 1 tablespoon of seed oil, add the thinly sliced spring onions and garlic powder, heat 1 minute, then add the cooked peas and shrimp and saute a few minutes.</p>

<a href='https://cookingwithtina.github.io//cantonese-fried-rice/photo5782690774620683314/#main'><img width="119" height="96" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/05/photo5782690774620683314.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" loading="lazy" /></a>
<a href='https://cookingwithtina.github.io//cantonese-fried-rice/photo5782690774620683317/#main'><img width="109" height="96" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/05/photo5782690774620683317.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" loading="lazy" /></a>

<p>Add the scrambled eggs, cold rice, and add the sauces, stir to coat the rice and cook over high heat for 2-3 minutes until the liquid evaporates, then turn off the heat. Finally add the cooked ham and let it mix for a few more seconds (the ham should not cook!). Add another tablespoon of oyster or soy sauce if desired! <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8820" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/05/photo5782690774620683319.jpg" alt="" width="1140" height="945" /> Here&#8217;s your <strong>Cantonese Rice </strong>ready, colorful and flavorful, serve it with the appropriate chopsticks, just Chinese style! <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8821" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/05/photo5782690774620683316.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="960" /></p>

</li>
<li>
<div class="recipe-ingredient-item ingredient_font_size_small">1 glass of<span class="recipe-ingredient-name"> white wine </span></div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="recipe-ingredient-item ingredient_font_size_small">1/2 onion, chopped</div>
</li>
<li>
<div class="recipe-ingredient-item ingredient_font_size_small">1 sprig of parsley</div>
</li>
<li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
<li>2-3 tablespoons <span class="recipe-ingredient-name"> Extra-virgin olive oil</span></li>
<li>butter and grated Grana Padano cheese for creaming</li>
</ul>
<p>Start the preparation of Risotto with Sausage and Zucchini from the <a href="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//brodo-di-carne/">meat stock</a>, which you can also use for other preparations, and keep it warm. In a large saucepan, saut√© the thinly sliced onion in the oil for 3 minutes, then add the sausage stripped of its casing and crumbled with a fork; let it season for a few minutes while keeping the flame fairly high and stirring with a spoon. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8725" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/04/photo5928999316595258899.jpg" alt="" width="1017" height="930" /> Add the rice and <span class="tooltip_termine tooltip_72" title="" data-original-title="Riscaldare un alimento solido fino a farlo colorire, senza aggiungere grassi o liquidi.">toast</span> it for 3-4 minutes over high heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon. Deglaze with the white wine and let it evaporate. At this point, add the zucchini previously cut into cubes or strips, adjust the salt and pepper, and season to taste. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8726" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/04/photo5928999316595258895.jpg" alt="" width="1101" height="945" /> Lower the heat and cook the rice by adding a few ladles of hot broth to cover the rice, let it cook and then add more broth a little at a time, only when the risotto begins to dry out. Cook the risotto for the time indicated, about 13 to 15 minutes. When it is almost cooked, turn up the heat in order to evaporate the excess broth, then season with parsley and more pepper and cream with butter and grated cheese. Serve piping hot and enjoy! <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8727" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/04/photo5928999316595258900.jpg" alt="" width="1054" height="948" /> <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8728" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/04/photo5928999316595258897.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="960" /></p>

<p>Meat cannelloni, stuffed with Bolognese pork ragout, b√©chamel sauce and Parmesan cheese, is a classic first course of the Italian tradition, rich and flavorful, perfect for any festive occasion, such as Christmas or Easter, or simply for Sunday lunch with the family. It is a dish made with squares of fresh dough: first they are filled with ground meat, then arranged in a baking dish, covered with tomato sauce, b√©chamel sauce, parmesan cheese and finally baked in the oven: a truly unique treat! You can conveniently prepare them the day before, store them in the refrigerator and bake them at the time, or bake them well in advance and reheat them for the occasion!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Doses for 6 large cannelloni:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>250 g package of ready-made lasagna (6 sheets)</li>
<li>300 gr of minced beef</li>
<li>150 gr of sausage</li>
<li>700 gr tomato sauce (350 gr for the meat sauce and 350 gr for the sauce)</li>
<li>2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil</li>
<li>100 gr of grated parmesan cheese</li>
<li>1 teaspoon of sugar</li>
<li>1/2 onion</li>
<li>1 small piece of celery</li>
<li>1 small piece of carrot</li>
<li>1/2 glass of wine (white or red of your choice)</li>
<li>300 ml meat stock</li>
<li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
<li>250 gr whole milk + 1 glass for the meat sauce</li>
<li>20 gr butter + 15 gr</li>
<li>20 gr of flour</li>
<li>salt</li>
<li>pepper</li>
<li>nutmeg to taste.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To prepare the cannelloni start with the <a href="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//ragu-di-carne/">meat sauce</a>: heat a tablespoon of oil in a large pot with chopped celery, carrot and onion, add chopped sausage (remove the casing) and beef and stew for 5-6 minutes. Deglaze with wine and stir, as soon as the alcohol has evaporated add 350 g of tomato puree and the beef stock, stir it all together. Season with salt and pepper and simmer with the lid on low heat for at least 2 hours. Add a glass of milk, open the lid a little and let it cook another hour, letting the meat sauce dry out well, then let it cool.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1006" height="938" class="wp-image-8631" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/02/photo5827705841518753794.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Prepare the sauce for seasoning, placing the remaining passata (350 g) on the stove with 2 to 3 tablespoons of water, a tablespoon of oil and cook 15 minutes, season with salt, also add sugar and set aside.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now prepare the <a href="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//besciamella/">b√©chamel sauce</a>: put the butter in a pan, melt it and then add the flour. Stir well with a whisk and then slowly add the milk, salt and nutmeg. Keep stirring until the cream thickens.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="951" height="915" class="wp-image-8632" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/02/photo5827705841518753791.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Take the ready lasagna sheets and blanch them one by one for a few seconds in a pot of lightly salted water. Lay the sheets on a kitchen towel and let them cool for a few seconds.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Even if it says &#8220;no cooking&#8221; on the lasagna package, I still recommend blanching them, so you&#8217;ll be able to seal the cannelloni well!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When all the ingredients are perfectly chilled you can proceed with the assembly: take a rectangle of pasta and stuff it with the meat sauce and a sprinkling of Parmesan cheese on one side only, leaving a couple of cm from the edge on the wide side; then roll the sheet of pasta on itself. Seal the dough to form cylinders.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>360 gr of Risotto Rice (Carnaroli or Vialone nano)</li>
<li>550 gr of pumpkin already cleaned</li>
<li>360 gr of sausage</li>
<li>one onion</li>
<li>two tablespoons of oil + two tablespoons to season the pumpkin</li>
<li>1 liter of broth</li>
<li>25 gr butter</li>
<li>1 tablespoon Rosemary</li>
<li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
<li>nutmeg to taste</li>
<li>30 gr coarsely chopped cashews or hazelnuts or almonds</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To make the risotto with pumpkin and sausage, start by chopping the onion, then take the sausage, incise the casing with a small knife and gently pull it out with your hands to remove it, then chop the meat with a knife</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Slice the squash, remove the skin, transfer the slices to a baking sheet with baking paper. Season with olive oil, salt, pepper and the rosemary and bake in a static oven preheated to 190¬∞ for 20 minutes</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>While the squash is cooking, take care of the risotto: heat two tablespoons of oil in a pan and add the onion, cook for 5 minutes, then add the sausage and cook with the lid on for 6 to 7 minutes</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="890" height="808" class="wp-image-8258" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2021/11/photo5812266623795575696.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When the sausage is nicely browned, add the rice and toast it without a lid for 5 minutes, then continue cooking, adding broth a little at a time as needed, stirring the rice often</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="948" height="854" class="wp-image-8259" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2021/11/photo5812266623795575695-1.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cook the rice for about 12 minutes, in the meantime the pumpkin will be cooked, strain it and remove the rosemary sprigs, then mash it with a fork; add the pumpkin puree to the risotto and continue cooking, for about 6 minutes more</p>

<p>Speck dumplings are dumplings made of bread (preferably the kaiser bun, popular in South Tyrol, but stale bread will do!) kneaded together with milk, onion, eggs and diced speck. This rustic, autumnal and really tasty first course is typical of Trentino-Alto Adige, and can be served in <a href="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//brodo-di-carne/">meat broth</a> or, as in this recipe, with melted butter and pepper.

Pair this first course with <a href="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//zuppa-di-gulasch/">goulash</a> for a typical Trentino dinner!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>250 g stale bread (white rosette-type bread with the crust) cut into cubes</li>
<li>150 g South Tyrolean Speck with its fat part, diced</li>
<li>2 eggs</li>
<li>200 ml milk</li>
<li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
<li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
<li>2 tablespoons chopped parsley</li>
<li>1 tablespoon chopped chives</li>
<li>1 tablespoon flour</li>
<li>salt and pepper</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Begin preparation by finely chopping the onion; in a skillet, melt the butter over low heat, then add the chopped onion and diced speck.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Saut√© for 5 minutes, stirring, then turn off the heat and keep aside.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cut the stale bread into cubes and pour it into a bowl along with the milk, also add the eggs, chopped chives and parsley. Continue by adding the now-warmed speck and onion, the tablespoon of flour and start stirring to mix everything together (if the mixture turns out too dry, add more milk; if it turns out too sticky or soft, you can add very little more flour to the mixture).</p>

<p>Chicken, vegetable and cashew couscous is a typical North African dish that is simple, quick, fresh and light, made with durum wheat semolina and, in my version, flavored chicken, vegetables and dried fruits. It can be eaten hot or cold and is perfect as an appetizer, served in elegant single portions, for a light dinner among friends. This unique dish, very tasty, is also suitable for those who are watching their figure, ideal for those who want to take a quick meal to the office, perfect for a picnic in the &#8216;outdoors! If you like this recipe also try <a href="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//cous-cous-di-verdure/">my vegetarian version!</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>200 gr of precooked couscous</li>
<li>220 gr of water for the couscous</li>
<li>60 gr extra virgin olive oil (about 3 tablespoons)</li>
<li>450 gr of chicken breast</li>
<li>two tablespoons of soy sauce</li>
<li>one teaspoon of garlic powder</li>
<li>100 gr toasted, unsalted cashews</li>
<li>juice of half a lemon</li>
<li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
<li>two carrots</li>
<li>two zucchini</li>
<li>one spring onion</li>
<li>one sachet of saffron</li>
<li>curry and turmeric to taste.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Start the preparation from the chicken: dice the breast and put it in a bowl with a tablespoon of oil, soy sauce, lemon juice, garlic powder, salt and pepper to taste; cover with foil and let it flavor in the refrigerator for at least a couple of hours.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="714" height="687" class="wp-image-7869" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2021/05/photo5798749223548728651.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>After the time has passed, in a large frying pan, best wok type, pour the chicken, let it cook stirring often for about 5-7 minutes, until it has made a nice golden crust. Once ready, set the chicken aside</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="798" height="674" class="wp-image-7870" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2021/05/photo5798749223548728646.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the same pan with the chicken stock, heat a tablespoon of oil, pour in the chopped spring onion, then also add the chopped carrots, add a couple of tablespoons of water and stew for 5 minutes. Add the zucchini, again chopped, season with a teaspoon of turmeric and curry to taste, put the lid on and cook the vegetables over medium heat for 10 minutes, then remove the lid and let dry another 5 minutes. Finally, add the cashews.</p>

</li>
</ul>
</figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the meantime, prepare the couscous: pour it into a large bowl and add a tablespoon of oil, separately boil 220 g of water with a sachet of saffron and a teaspoon of salt, then turn off the heat and pour the broth over the couscous; cover with plastic wrap and let the couscous swell: this will take about 5 minutes. Shell the ready couscous with a fork.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

</li>
</ul>
</figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once the vegetables are ready and have cooled, pour them into the bowl, add the chicken, which is also cold, and mix everything together. Your cold chicken couscous is ready to serve, with a few basil leaves!</p>
