</li>
</ul>
<p>Start the preparation by chopping the vegetables, onion, carrot and garlic, heat the oil in a large pot and saut√© for 5 minutes. Add the veal roast and brown it well on all sides, then deglaze with the wine. Adjust the salt and pepper and add the rosemary.
<a href='https://cookingwithtina.github.io//pot-roast-veal/photo5938082846008785530/#main'><img width="106" height="96" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/04/photo5938082846008785530.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" loading="lazy" /></a>

</p>
<p>After adding the white wine, turn the roast several times to give it flavor, then add the meat stock, lower the heat to low. Now cover the pot with a lid and let the veal roast cook for about an hour. After an hour has passed, remove the lid, raise the flame and let the cooking liquid evaporate a little.
<a href='https://cookingwithtina.github.io//pot-roast-veal/photo5938082846008785536/#main'><img width="105" height="96" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/04/photo5938082846008785536.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" loading="lazy" /></a>

</p>
<blockquote><p>To adjust with cooking time: calculate about 55-60 minutes for each pound of meat!</p></blockquote>
<p>After cooking, arrange the veal roast on a plate. Remove the rosemary sprig from the pot and whisk the cooking juices using a food processor; in this way, the whipped cooking juices serve as a sauce to accompany the veal roast, after cutting it into slices, which you can reheat at the time.
<a href='https://cookingwithtina.github.io//pot-roast-veal/photo5938082846008785535/#main'><img width="118" height="96" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/04/photo5938082846008785535.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" loading="lazy" /></a>

</p>
<p>Serve your veal roast with your favorite vegetables!</p>
<blockquote><p>If you want to get more out of the cooking juices, you need to whisk it all up, put it back in the pot and add a few ladles of water. Place back on the heat, add a tablespoon of flour, mixed in a small glass of water. In this way you will get more of the cooking juices, to serve the veal roast that you have cooked in the pot.</p></blockquote>

<p>Beef with tuna sauce is a tasty, fresh, flavorful main course, perfect to enjoy cold for spring and summer lunches and dinners, and it can be prepared in advance. Thin slices of meat (I chose beef rump, but veal is also highly recommended) accompanied by a flavorful sauce made with tuna, mayonnaise and eggs. It is a dish that could be served as an appetizer, also suitable for transporting out of the house for an out-of-town lunch.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>800 g of beef swivel</li>
<li>1 onion</li>
<li>1 carrot</li>
<li>2 tablespoons oil</li>
<li>1 celery stalk</li>
<li>6-7 black peppercorns</li>
<li>1 clove of garlic</li>
<li>1 1/2 liters of water</li>
<li>1 glass of white wine</li>
<li>salt and pepper</li>
<li>3 hard-boiled eggs</li>
<li>150 g tuna in oil</li>
<li>3 tablespoons of mayonnaise</li>
<li>salt</li>
<li>pepper</li>
<li>beef broth to dilute</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Peel and chop the white onion, carrot, and shallot and saut√© them in a saucepan with the agio and 3 tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil and a pinch of salt until just golden.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Also put the beef, salt, and peppercorns in the casserole and pour over all the white wine, let it fade. Then add the water, which should cover everything, cover and cook over moderate heat for at least 1 hour. Use the roasting thermometer, inserting it perfectly in the center of the piece of meat to check the internal temperature: when it reaches 65¬∞ it will be just pink and ready to eat.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1076" height="908" class="wp-image-8687" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/03/photo5868676831635421407.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>At this point, move the meat to a bowl and let it cool completely; you can use the meat stock for other preparations, such as risotto or <a href="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//ragu-di-carne/">meat sauce</a>, taking care to set aside a couple of tablespoons for the tonnata sauce.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, move on to preparing the tonnata sauce: boil the eggs (when boiling, count 9 minutes of cooking time), then let them cool. In a blender put the hard-boiled yolks, add the drained tuna, mayonnaise, salt and pepper, and finally add a little broth. Blend until smooth and of the consistency you prefer.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="868" height="774" class="wp-image-8688" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/03/photo5868676831635421409.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thinly slice the now-warm meat with a smooth-bladed knife; arrange the slices in a serving dish and pour the resulting cream, making layers with the meat slices: cover with plastic wrap and leave to set in the refrigerator a few hours before serving.</p>

<p>Meatballs are a tasty, quick and easy dish of Italian tradition, prepared in many ways, depending on the location and the ingredients available. The only common element is the use of ground meat, which can belong to different cuts and animals; to this is usually added some wet stale bread or mashed boiled potatoes, and eggs; they are then lightly fried and given flavor in a good sauce, or cooked in a pan or in the oven. In this recipe I used four kinds of meat (veal, chicken, beef and pork), did not add soaked bread but a potato, and cooked them in a pan with white wine. Amazing result! Try my recipe for the four mince meatballs, your children and others will surely love it! If you have leftover broth meat, also try my recipe for <a href="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//polpettine-di-lesso/">boiled meatballs! </a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Doses for 55 meatballs of about 20 gr</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>200 gr ground veal meat</li>
<li>200 gr mixed ground beef and pork</li>
<li>300 gr ground chicken meat</li>
<li>one medium egg</li>
<li>one medium boiled potato</li>
<li>a teaspoon of garlic powder or a clove of minced garlic</li>
<li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
<li>a sprig of chopped parsley</li>
<li>Breadcrumbs to taste</li>
<li>1/2 glass of white wine</li>
<li>olive oil or seed oil to taste.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To prepare the meatballs, start by making the dough: in a large bowl put the ground meat, egg, boiled and mashed potato, salt, pepper, garlic and chopped parsley.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="924" height="890" class="wp-image-8200" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2021/09/photo5945178986680268838.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mix the ingredients to make a smooth dough, then form into many patties of about 20-22 g each.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1260" height="924" class="wp-image-8202" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2021/09/photo5945178986680268839.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Coat all the patties in breadcrumbs arranged in a small plate and refrigerate until ready to cook (you can prepare them the day before, too!)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1227" height="924" class="wp-image-8201" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2021/09/photo5945178986680268840.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To cook the patties: heat two tablespoons of olive oil in a large skillet and arrange the patties spaced apart, cook over medium-high heat two minutes on one side and two minutes on the other side, then lower the heat and deglaze with white wine. Cover with the lid and cook another 5 to 6 minutes, then turn them over and cook another 5 minutes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Remove the lid, raise the flame and let it evaporate until cooked.</p>

<p>Serve your patties with your favorite sauces and a side of fresh or cooked vegetables or some chips!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>If you prefer, you can also fry your patties: so use a deep fryer and bring the frying oil to a temperature that does not exceed 170-180¬∞. When it is hot enough, dip 2-3 meatballs at a time so that the oil temperature does not drop too low, cook for a few minutes (2-3 minutes will be enough) until nicely browned, then transfer the cooked meatballs to paper towels just long enough to wipe off the excess oil.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Start the preparation by peeling the potatoes and cutting them into pieces, then cook them in salted boiling water for about 10-12 minutes, then drain and set aside; in another pot also cook the chopped cod and boil it for about 10 minutes, drain that too.</p>

<p>Beef Stroganoff is a creamy, flavorful main course that originated in Russian cuisine: it consists of beef cut into strips and cooked with onion, tomato puree, all of which is tinged with vodka and flavored with<em> smetana cream</em> (or sour cream) and mustard. This hearty and nutritious dish is easy to make and very satisfying; make it if you want to impress your diners!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>There are two versions about the origin of this particular recipe, which is roughly in the mid-19th century: according to some, the dish was first prepared by a French chef in the service of Russian Count Pavel Stroganoff who, in order to make beef fricassee more palatable to his master, added a sauce made from sour cream; according to the other version, on the other hand, the recipe would take its name from the doctor who cured Tsarina Maria of food poisoning caused by herring with a diet of beef, onions and sour cream.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>800 gr Beef Meat (tenderloin, sirloin, pink or walnut)</li>
<li>500 gr white onions</li>
<li>50 gr Butter</li>
<li>to taste Parsley for chopping</li>
<li>q.b. Fine salt and black pepper</li>
<li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
<li>25 g flour</li>
<li>40 gr of tomato puree</li>
<li>a small glass of vodka or brandy</li>
<li>one tablespoon of mustard</li>
<li>80 gr <em>smetana sauce</em> *</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>* For the smetana sauce (which you can substitute with sour cream):</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>250 ml fresh cream</li>
<li>40 gr of mascarpone cheese</li>
<li>juice of half a lemon</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To prepare beef stroganoff, start by preparing the smetana sauce: just whip the cream, add the mascarpone and the juice of the lemons, then letting it sit for about two hours. You can skip this preparation and use 80 g of sour cream.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="870" height="858" class="wp-image-7954" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2021/05/photo5881711456083359761.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finely slice the onions and wilt them 20 minutes in a large pot, along with 25 gr butter and a drizzle of oil; then set aside.</p>

<p>Cut the beef into strips with a well-sharpened knife, flour them and season with salt, pepper and the &#8216;garlic powder; cook them with a drizzle of oil and the remaining 25 g butter in the same pan over high heat; as soon as they start to brown, deglaze with the vodka or brandy and continue to cook for 5 to 6 minutes.</p>

<p>Finally, add the onions and 80 gm of smetana cream taken from the total dose (you can use the &#8216;other part for other preparations, such as accompanying it to <a href="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//blinis-con-e-senza-il-bimby/">Blinis</a>!) and cook another 10 minutes over high heat, until the cream is well blended and dry.</p>

<p>The recipe for Beef Stroganoff has several variations including, a very popular one, the addition of champignon mushrooms, to be cooked along with the onions.

<li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a large frying pan, preferably a wok, heat the sesame oil along with the chopped or grated ginger and flavor for 2 minutes, then add the sliced leek and cook another 2 minutes.

<p>Pan-fried roast veal is a very tender, light, easy-to-prepare, tasty main course, a classic Italian recipe that is usually prepared on Sundays or for a special family meal. With this recipe you will easily get an excellent roast with tender and juicy meat; accompany it with a side of grilled vegetables, baked or mashed potatoes, to enjoy the gravy even better!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>1 kg of veal for roast (I found it already tied with string at the supermarket!)</li>
<li>one onion</li>
<li>one carrot</li>
<li>4 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil</li>
<li>1 sprig of rosemary</li>
<li>garlic powder one teaspoon</li>
<li>1 glass of white wine</li>
<li>1 glass of broth or water and stock cube</li>
<li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
<li>one teaspoon of starch</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you can&#8217;t find the meat already prepared, you need to tie the piece of meat (I recommend walnut, or undercut) with kitchen twine, trying to give it a regular shape. You can prepare this recipe the day before-it will be even tastier.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finely chop the onion and carrot and brown them in a large pot with olive oil, for 5 minutes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Add the rosemary sprig, garlic powder and the veal roast, and brown it well on all sides, so as to seal the meat well, preserving the juices that are inside and keeping it tender while cooking.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then add the white wine and deglaze, then turn the roast several times to give it flavor; add the stock or water, salt and pepper and lower the heat to low.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cover the pot with a lid and let the veal roast cook for about an hour and a half, turning it occasionally. After an hour of cooking, raise the heat and let some of the cooking liquid evaporate, with the lid slightly open.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Arrange the veal roast on a plate and cut it into slices; remove the rosemary sprig from the pot and blend everything with a food processor, add a teaspoon of starch or cornstarch or flour, stir and return to the heat. Thicken the pan juices until you have a sauce to go with the veal roast, then turn off the heat.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>10 g fresh ginger</li>
<li>50 gr chopped carrots</li>
<li>30 gr of cooked ham</li>
<li>300 gr chopped pork</li>
<li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
<li>a teaspoon of sesame oil (alternatively seed oil)</li>
<li>400 gr of water</li>
<li>one tablespoon of soy sauce</li>
<li>one teaspoon of granulated stock cube</li>
<li>10 gr of cornstarch</li>
<li>20 gr rice vinegar or mirim or sake</li>
<li>2 sliced spring onions</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the Bimby: put the ginger in the mug and mince 2 seconds/speed 8, then bring together with the spatula</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Add the carrots and cooked ham and chop 5 seconds/speed 5</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you do not have a Bimby, you can use an ordinary food processor.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Add the pork, salt, pepper, oil and blend 2 minutes/speed 2</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Without the Bimby, transfer the meat to a large bowl, add the chopped vegetables and mix the mixture with your hands.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Form into balls of about 15 g each and spread them on the Varoma dish; if you do not have the Bimby, any steamer will do.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pour the water into the mug, place the Varoma with the meatballs and cook 15 min/Varoma/speed 1. While cooking, mix the rice vinegar with the cornstarch without forming lumps.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Add the sliced spring onions and cook 2 minutes/Varoma/speed 1.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you do not have a Bimby, after steaming the meatballs (always 15 minutes) you can prepare the sauce in a small saucepan with the same ingredients and cook until smooth and thick.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Transfer the Chinese meatballs to a serving plate, add the thick sauce on top and serve with basmati rice and soy sauce!</p>
