										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Colored Vol-au-vents are baskets made from several overlapping layers of puff pastry, brushed with egg and baked in the oven, then filled with soft pea cream and boiled quail eggs, or with mayonnaise, lumpfish eggs and smoked salmon. A must on holiday tables, beautiful to look at and easy to prepare, these canestrini are served as an appetizer or finger food, and can be stuffed in a variety of ways, from sweet to savory. The filling inside them is usually based on meat, fish, vegetables, cheese, and mushrooms; however, the dough from which the vol au vent are made has a neutral taste, which can also be combined with sweet preparations, with creams and fruit. With this filling made with peas, mayonnaise, salmon and eggs you will look great for a buffet with friends or for a family Holiday appetizer!</p>
<blockquote><p>The name &#8220;Vol au vent&#8221; comes from the fact that they are light enough to be carried &#8220;away on the wind.&#8221; Their origin is attributed to French chef Marie-Antoine Carême who allegedly substituted a heavy crust for the light dough. However, in François Marin&#8217;s 1739 cookbook &#8220;<i>Les Dons de Comus</i>,&#8221; which predates Antoine Carême&#8217;s birth, a sweet dessert called &#8220;wind pie&#8221; is mentioned.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"></sup></p></blockquote>
<div class="col-md-6">
<div class="c-recipe__list2 c-typo1--body1 --theme-light3--text-links-interact-orange2">
<p>Ingredients for 10 vol-au-vents:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 puff pastry disks</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="col-md-6 col-md-f40">
<div class="c-recipe__list2 c-typo1--body1 --theme-light3--text-links-interact-orange2">
<ul>
<li>1 egg for brushing</li>
<li>10 quail eggs</li>
<li>150 g frozen peas</li>
<li>2/3 basil leaves</li>
<li>4/5 slices of smoked salmon</li>
<li>mayonnaise to taste</li>
<li>5 lumpfish eggs</li>
<li>salt and pepper</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p>To prepare the filled vol-au-vents, roll out the first puff pastry and cut out disks with a pastry cutter; proceed with the second puff pastry as well. Place the resulting discs on a baking sheet lined with baking paper and brush them with egg, while cupping the center of the remaining discs with a smaller pastry cutter to create many crowns.</p>

<p>Prick the whole discs so that they do not swell excessively in baking, then lay the pierced discs on top of the large discs, 3 each, also &#8216;brushed with egg.</p>

<p>Bake in a preheated static oven at 200º for about 12 to 14 minutes; take out of the oven and let them cool completely. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8784" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2022/05/photo6012704488277784012.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="960" /></p>
<blockquote><p>If the bottom has risen a bit after baking, you can gently squish it down with a teaspoon!</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="ILfuVd"><span class="hgKElc">For the filling of the vol-au-vents, boil the peas in lightly salted water, then whisk them together with the basil, a teaspoon of oil, salt and pepper and a tablespoon of cooking water until creamy. For hard-boiled quail eggs, on the other hand, you need to boil them in water for 3-4 minutes from the time they first boil. </span></span> It&#8217;s time to fill your vol-au-vents: so use the pea cream and fill 5, then add one egg each and a sprinkling of oregano.</p>

<p>For salmon vol-au-vents, use mayonnaise, salmon and the lumpfish eggs.</p>

<p>Fold the savory croissants back up, starting with the base: roll it on itself until you reach the tip of the triangle. Lay the newly made savory croissants on a baking sheet lined with baking paper; brush the surface with egg yolk or milk and sprinkle with a few sesame seeds. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8749" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2022/04/photo5972142022565411042.jpg" alt="" width="1242" height="939" /> Bake your Savory Croissants in a static oven at 200° for 15 to 18 minutes, then take them out of the oven and let them cool. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8750" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2022/04/photo5972142022565411057.jpg" alt="" width="1272" height="846" /> To make the <strong>Pizzette </strong>, prepare the tomato sauce by heating the oil, sauce, paste, salt and sugar for a few minutes, then let cool <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8752" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2022/04/photo5972142022565411045.jpg" alt="" width="933" height="834" /> Unroll a rectangular roll of puff pastry directly into a baking dish, cut with a knife along vertical and then horizontal strips to make about 2-inch squares; put a teaspoon of tomato sauce in the center, then close two corners in the middle and add oregano.</p>

With a well-sharpened knife carve a grid first all vertical strips, then all horizontal strips, so as to make squares.</p>

<p>Bake the appetizers in the middle part of a static oven preheated to 200° and let them bake for about 15 minutes, then take them out of the oven and let them cool out of the pan and serve.</p>

Arrange the rolls on a baking sheet with baking paper, brush them with egg yolk or milk, and bake in a preheated oven at 200° for about 12 to 15 minutes until the pastry is golden brown.</p>

<blockquote><p>Delicious variants for the filling of Croissants, Pizzette or Stuzzichini: you can use cooked ham, salami, speck, crudo, or other cold cuts of your choice; instead of philadelphia and artichokes you can spread some tomato and grana cheese, olive pate, pesto alla genovese, acciunghe pasta, tuna and mayonnaise, pesto and ricotta cheese, ricotta cheese and grana cheese or add to the red and white bases cold cuts, cheeses such as fontina or edamer and vegetables of your choice! You can make pizzas with ricotta, mozzarella or other cheeses..in short really whatever you prefer!</p></blockquote>

<p>Mushroom and buffalo mozzarella savory pie is a really tasty dish with a rich and intense aroma that is quick and easy to prepare in advance. Perfect at any time of year and on any occasion, this is a great recipe to enjoy at lunch, dinner or during an aperitif with friends, as an alternative to pizza and also perfect for a lunch out celebrating Easter or Easter Monday.<br />Its rustic flavor and delicious aroma will win you over at the first taste, especially when accompanied by a cold beer!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>200 gr of 00 flour</li>
<li>100 gr chopped butter</li>
<li>50 ml cold water</li>
<li>a pinch of salt</li>
<li>700 gr mixed mushrooms (I used prataioli and cardoncello)</li>
<li>1/2 glass of white wine</li>
<li>2 tablespoons of olive oil</li>
<li>one clove of garlic</li>
<li>parsley</li>
<li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
<li>one buffalo mozzarella</li>
<li>1 egg</li>
<li>100 ml fresh cream</li>
<li>40 g grated parmesan cheese</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Start the preparation from the brisee dough: Place the flour in a well on the work surface or in a bowl or in the blender. Cut the well-cold refrigerated butter into pieces and add it to the flour, working it quickly with your hands so that it crumbles; add the cold water and pinch of salt, a little at a time, always kneading with your other hand.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="936" height="897" class="wp-image-8711" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2022/03/photo5906931478275668341.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Continue kneading with your hands until you get a smooth, well-blended dough; form into a round loaf and refrigerate 30 minutes wrapped in plastic wrap.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="784" height="646" class="wp-image-8712" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2022/03/photo5906931478275668339.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Prepare the mushrooms: remove any remaining soil with a small brush or cloth, then slice all the mushrooms. Heat the two tablespoons of oil in a pan with the garlic clove cut in half; add the mushrooms and cook over high heat for 5 minutes, deglazing with the wine. Lower the heat, season with salt and pepper and continue cooking for 20 minutes over medium heat. At the end of cooking, remove the garlic, season with parsley, if necessary let the cooking liquid dry for 5/6 minutes on high heat without a lid, then let cool.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1020" height="954" class="wp-image-8713" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2022/03/photo5906931478275668337.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>With a whisk, mix the egg with the cream and grated cheese in a bowl. Add the mushroom mixture and stir to combine.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="921" height="894" class="wp-image-8714" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2022/03/photo5906931478275668336.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Roll out the brisee dough on a sheet of baking paper greased with oil, using a rolling pin, obtaining a sheet about 3 mm. thick; place it with its baking paper inside a 22-cm-diameter mold, prick the base with the tines of a fork and pour the prepared mixture inside.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1193" height="951" class="wp-image-8715" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2022/03/photo5906931478275668338.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Add the lightly squeezed sliced buffalo mozzarella and bake in a static oven preheated to 180° for 40 minutes. When finished baking, unmold the savory pie and let it cool before bringing it to the table.</p>

<p>Meat cannelloni, stuffed with Bolognese pork ragout, béchamel sauce and Parmesan cheese, is a classic first course of the Italian tradition, rich and flavorful, perfect for any festive occasion, such as Christmas or Easter, or simply for Sunday lunch with the family. It is a dish made with squares of fresh dough: first they are filled with ground meat, then arranged in a baking dish, covered with tomato sauce, béchamel sauce, parmesan cheese and finally baked in the oven: a truly unique treat! You can conveniently prepare them the day before, store them in the refrigerator and bake them at the time, or bake them well in advance and reheat them for the occasion!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Doses for 6 large cannelloni:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>250 g package of ready-made lasagna (6 sheets)</li>
<li>300 gr of minced beef</li>
<li>150 gr of sausage</li>
<li>700 gr tomato sauce (350 gr for the meat sauce and 350 gr for the sauce)</li>
<li>2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil</li>
<li>100 gr of grated parmesan cheese</li>
<li>1 teaspoon of sugar</li>
<li>1/2 onion</li>
<li>1 small piece of celery</li>
<li>1 small piece of carrot</li>
<li>1/2 glass of wine (white or red of your choice)</li>
<li>300 ml meat stock</li>
<li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
<li>250 gr whole milk + 1 glass for the meat sauce</li>
<li>20 gr butter + 15 gr</li>
<li>20 gr of flour</li>
<li>salt</li>
<li>pepper</li>
<li>nutmeg to taste.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To prepare the cannelloni start with the <a href="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//ragu-di-carne/">meat sauce</a>: heat a tablespoon of oil in a large pot with chopped celery, carrot and onion, add chopped sausage (remove the casing) and beef and stew for 5-6 minutes. Deglaze with wine and stir, as soon as the alcohol has evaporated add 350 g of tomato puree and the beef stock, stir it all together. Season with salt and pepper and simmer with the lid on low heat for at least 2 hours. Add a glass of milk, open the lid a little and let it cook another hour, letting the meat sauce dry out well, then let it cool.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1006" height="938" class="wp-image-8631" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2022/02/photo5827705841518753794.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Prepare the sauce for seasoning, placing the remaining passata (350 g) on the stove with 2 to 3 tablespoons of water, a tablespoon of oil and cook 15 minutes, season with salt, also add sugar and set aside.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now prepare the <a href="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//besciamella/">béchamel sauce</a>: put the butter in a pan, melt it and then add the flour. Stir well with a whisk and then slowly add the milk, salt and nutmeg. Keep stirring until the cream thickens.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="951" height="915" class="wp-image-8632" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2022/02/photo5827705841518753791.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Take the ready lasagna sheets and blanch them one by one for a few seconds in a pot of lightly salted water. Lay the sheets on a kitchen towel and let them cool for a few seconds.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Even if it says &#8220;no cooking&#8221; on the lasagna package, I still recommend blanching them, so you&#8217;ll be able to seal the cannelloni well!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When all the ingredients are perfectly chilled you can proceed with the assembly: take a rectangle of pasta and stuff it with the meat sauce and a sprinkling of Parmesan cheese on one side only, leaving a couple of cm from the edge on the wide side; then roll the sheet of pasta on itself. Seal the dough to form cylinders.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1234" height="720" class="wp-image-8635" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2022/02/photo5827705841518753787.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pour 1 ladleful of sauce and meat sauce into a large baking dish, place all the pasta cylinders back into the dish; top with tomato sauce, soft béchamel sauce ( if you have prepared it) finally with Parmesan cheese and 15 g of chopped butter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Fortune cookies are crunchy treats, of Japanese origin, very simple and original: they are crescent-shaped cookies, flavored with vanilla, made with egg whites, sugar, oil, flour and vanillin, inside of which is enclosed a message, usually prophetic or even divinatory phrases, but it can also be personalized! Their preparation is very simple, but care must be taken not to overcook them, or undercook them, and once they are baked, when quickly the leaflet should be inserted and the cookie folded and set aside to cool. Try making homemade fortune cookies to surprise friends at the end of a special evening, or personalize them to make a truly original Valentine&#8217;s Day gift!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ingredients for about 14 cookies:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>75 g egg whites</li>
<li>110 gr of sugar</li>
<li>90 gr of 00 flour</li>
<li>20 gr of cornstarch</li>
<li>15 gr melted butter or extra virgin olive oil</li>
<li>one sachet vanillin</li>
<li>2 tablespoons of water</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To prepare the fortune cookies recipe, before you start write the messages that will go inside the cookies, cutting out small strips of light paper; I wrote phrases to dedicate to my husband, for Valentine&#8217;s Day!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>First prepare the dough: pour the egg whites and sugar into a bowl and beat with a whisk to combine them, but without whipping them to stiff peaks. Add the melted butter or oil, vanillin, 00 flour and sifted cornstarch.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1044" height="927" class="wp-image-8582" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2022/02/photo5785005826417735899.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mix well, again with a kitchen whisk, then add a couple of tablespoons of water until you have a creamy mixture, a rather thick batter.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="963" height="960" class="wp-image-8583" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2022/02/photo5785005826417735898.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cover a baking sheet with baking paper and draw circles using a glass about 7/8 cm in diameter, spacing them slightly apart.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Take a generous teaspoon of the mixture, place it in the center of a circle on the baking paper and with the back of the teaspoon expand it in circular motions until the circle is filled. You will need to get a thin layer. Since fortune cookies should be closed and folded while they are still warm, bake them three/four at a time so you have plenty of time to proceed with the folding.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1208" height="891" class="wp-image-8584" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2022/02/photo5785005826417735902.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bake and bake for 7 to 8 minutes in a static oven preheated to 175°; do not bake them longer or they will be too hard and you will not be able to fold them and they will all break (as happened to me, lucky I had more dough!!)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1246" height="868" class="wp-image-8585" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2022/02/photo5785005826417735901.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once they are baked, turn them upside down so that the side in contact with the plate becomes the inside of the cookie, lay a small card in the center of each with your favorite message, close it in a crescent shape and fold the two tips down (gently and being careful not to break them).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Use the rim of a glass or with the rim of a cup to give the cookies their characteristic shape by folding them over and bringing the ends closer together</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Place the cookies thus formed inside a muffin mold and let them cool so that they keep their shape. Once cooled, your fortune cookies are ready to be enjoyed, and how satisfying!</p>

<p>Stuffed Bugie are crispy, crumbly and soft on the inside, typical Carnival treats; a mouth-watering variation of <a href="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//chiacchere-o-galani/">Chiacchiere</a>; in this case the thin sheets are stuffed with a soft Nutella filling, closed in the shape of a dumpling and finally fried. These treats are super easy to make; the basic dough is that of the <a href="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//chiacchere-o-galani/">Chiacchere</a>, then all you have to do is roll out the pastry, stuff it, seal it well and fry; one pulls the other, and it&#8217;s party time! And for a truly complete Carnival buffet, try my recipe for <a href="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//castagnole-fritte-neutre-e-alla-nutella/">Fried Castagnole</a>, too!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ingredients for 22 bugias:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>50 gr Butter at room temperature</li>
<li>200 gr Flour 00</li>
<li>50 ml White wine (or grappa, or anise or strega liqueur)</li>
<li>30 gr Sugar</li>
<li>1 whole egg</li>
<li>1 lemon peel</li>
<li>1 pinch of Salt</li>
<li>a teaspoon of baking powder for cakes</li>
<li>a sachet of vanillin</li>
<li>200 g Nutella</li>
<li>Seed oil for frying</li>
<li>Powdered sugar to taste.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Place the flour, egg, softened butter, sugar, pinch of salt, wine, grated lemon zest and baking powder in a large bowl; start kneading with your hands.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once the mixture has become smooth and nonsticky, form it into a ball, cover it with plastic wrap and place it to rest in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

</li>
</ul>
</figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once the resting time has passed, take the dough, divide it into 3 parts and roll it out, one at a time, with a rolling pin (or pasta machine) into a 3/4 mm thin sheet, on a well-floured work surface; fold the sheet over itself a couple of times and roll it out again, this way it will fill with bubbles in baking!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

</li>
</ul>
</figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once the dough is rolled out, add the filling: 1 teaspoon of Nutella about 3 cm apart</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1269" height="603" class="wp-image-8560" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2022/02/photo6050711697557142007.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Brush the edges of the filling with water, close the lies and carve the outlines as if to make ravioli. With these doses you will get 22 bugie (I had leftover dough and also made 2 galani!)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

</li>
</ul>
</figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Heat a small pan with plenty of seed oil to a temperature of 170°. Fry a few pieces at a time, turning after a few seconds! The stuffed lies will puff up immediately! Just a few seconds and you can drain them on a plate lined with paper towels.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Immediately place the stuffed lies in a serving dish and sprinkle with powdered sugar, serve immediately or store them in a paper bag for a couple of days!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>Chiacchere are known throughout Italy but have many regional variations that are evident not only in the ingredients and preparation, but starting with the name itself: in Lazio they are often called <em>Frappe</em>, in Tuscany <em>Cenci</em> or <em>Donzelle</em>, in Sicily <em>chiacchiere</em>, <em>frappe</em> in Lazio, <em>bugie</em> in Piedmont and Liguria, <em>Sfrappole</em> in Emilia, <em>Cròstoli</em> in Trentino and <em>Galani or Gale </em>in Veneto!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then with a jagged wheel cut medium-sized rectangles from the pastry sheet and in the center make two parallel cuts on the side of the longest side of the rectangle; place the rectangles, spaced so that they do not stick together, on lightly floured cutting boards or serving plates.</p>

Pandoro is the classic Christmas cake originating from Verona: it is a leavened dough made of flour, eggs, butter, sugar, and flavorings, which requires a little patience and about three days of preparation, but it is definitely worth it! With a soft texture and golden surface, fragrant, delicious, perfect to sweeten you during the Christmas holidays!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The origins of Pandoro are ancient and date back to the 1500s; when the &#8220;<em>pan de oro</em>&#8221; was served on the tables of wealthy Venetians. But it was Domenico Melegatti, founder of the confectionery company of the same name, who filed the official patent for the modern recipe of this soft dessert in 1892!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A few tips:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>All ingredients used, especially butter and eggs, should be at room temperature and not cold from the refrigerator.</li>
<li>Use Manitoba flour, which, due to the presence of a lot of gluten will ensure optimal alveolation for this cake.</li>
<li>Use an electric mixer or a planetary mixer or the Bimby, at the lowest speed and do not be in a hurry when making it, give the planetary mixer the right amount of time to work everything and the dough to rise. Nothing prohibits you from using your hands to knead, but at least for 10 minutes!</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>TOTAL ingredients for a 1 kg mold</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>450 g of Manitoba-type strong flour (with W of 350 0 460)</li>
<li>5 gr dry brewer&#8217;s yeast</li>
<li>70 gr of water</li>
<li>3 whole eggs</li>
<li>1 yolk</li>
<li>200 gr soft butter (30 gr for the 1st dough + 140 gr for the puffing* + 30 gr melted butter)</li>
<li>135 gr sugar</li>
<li>8 gr fine salt</li>
<li>grated peel of one orange</li>
<li>grated peel of one lemon</li>
<li>2 tbsp honey</li>
<li>2 tablespoons vanilla extract (or the seeds of 1 berry)</li>
<li>1 generous tablespoon of rum</li>
<li>powdered sugar to taste.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Start the night before by preparing the flavor mix: pour the honey, grated lemon zest, grated orange zest, vanilla and rum into a bowl; mix, cover with foil and store at room temperature until used. Take 30 g butter and eggs out of the refrigerator and leave at room temperature.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>9 a.</strong> m. Next day, preparation of Biga:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>50 gr flour</li>
<li>60 gr of water</li>
<li>3 gr dry yeast</li>
<li>10 gr sugar</li>
<li>1 yolk</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a bowl pour the flour, water, yeast, sugar and egg yolk and mix everything with a spoon until a soft dough is obtained; cover with plastic wrap and let rise until it doubles in size and forms many small bubbles on the surface (about <strong>1 1/2 hours</strong>).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>10:30</strong> a.m. Preparation of the First Dough:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>the well-fermented pre-dough</li>
<li>200 g flour</li>
<li>2 gr dry yeast</li>
<li>10 gr water</li>
<li>25 gr of sugar</li>
<li>30 gr softened butter</li>
<li>1 whole egg at room temperature</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pour the biga into the bowl of a planetary mixer or the Bimby, add the flour and sugar, also add the yeast and the room temperature egg. Operate the planetary mixer and let it work for about 10 minutes until the dough is smooth and well strung together. Finally, gradually add the soft butter in small pieces, kneading at medium speed (with the Bimby &#8220;spike&#8221; mode) until it is fully absorbed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Transfer the dough to a flat surface, give it a couple of folds and a spherical shape, then transfer it to a large, tall bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let <strong>rise for 2 to 3 hours</strong> at room temperature, or in the oven turned off with the light on-the dough should double in size</p>

<p>Pour the previous risen dough into the planetary mixer or Bimby, add in the flour, sugar and aromatic mix and knead a few seconds; add the eggs one at a time, always kneading at medium speed. Finally add the salt; continue kneading the dough until it has a soft consistency that pulls away from the sides.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Turn out onto work surface, give firm folds, place dough inside a large bowl lightly buttered and covered with foil and let rise inside oven with light on for about 2 h, almost doubling in volume.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>At this point knead quickly, then place the dough <strong>in the refrigerator to ripen 20 h</strong>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>350 gr of dry cookies of the Oro Saiwa type</li>
<li>170 gr of butter</li>
<li>200 gr of dark chocolate</li>
<li>2 eggs</li>
<li>30 gr of bitter cocoa</li>
<li>20 ml brandy or rum or orange juice</li>
<li>100 gr sugar</li>
<li>powdered sugar to taste</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To prepare the chocolate salami, first melt the chocolate and butter in pieces in the microwave or bain-marie, then let it cool. Meanwhile, beat the eggs and sugar separately with a whisk until creamy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Roughly crumble the dry cookies with your hands, add the chocolate mixture to the cookies, add the eggs, cocoa and brandy (or orange juice if there are children!) then mix everything together with a spatula.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now take a sheet of baking paper and pour the mixture into the center, shaping it with your hands to give it a cylindrical shape. Lift the bottom flap and wrap the baking paper around the cylinder, then roll up the ends to seal it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Transfer the roll to the refrigerator and let it firm up for at least 2 to 3 hours, preferably overnight. After this time has elapsed, remove the baking paper and dust with powdered sugar. Your chocolate salami is ready to be sliced and enjoyed!</p>

<p>Bride Cookies called &#8220;Corolli&#8221; are delicious and colorful, soft, simple and quick to prepare doughnuts, typical of Tuscan cuisine, which were prepared at weddings to celebrate the wedding day. These shortbread-based cookies are first baked, then pureed in Alchermes and sugar: this gives them their classic bright pink color and typical sweetness. I made them on the occasion of a bachelorette party for a dear friend, but you can make them for other occasions, such as an original end of the meal, or for an afternoon with girlfriends!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Doses for 38 cookies:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>400 gr of 00 flour</li>
<li>150 gr granulated sugar + 200 gr for the icing</li>
<li>130 gr of butter</li>
<li>2 eggs</li>
<li>half a sachet of baking powder for cakes</li>
<li>a sachet of vanillin or vanilla flavoring</li>
<li>salt 1 pinch</li>
<li>200 ml Alchermes liqueur</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Prepare the shortcrust pastry: put the sifted flour and baking powder in a large bowl, break the eggs and sugar into the center, add the butter cut into chunks, the vanilla and the pinch of salt. Mix everything well until it forms a dough ball, which you will leave in the refrigerator wrapped in plastic wrap for 30 minutes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-container-44 wp-block-gallery-43 wp-block-gallery columns-2 is-cropped">
<ul class="blocks-gallery-grid">
<li class="blocks-gallery-item">
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1032" height="960" class="wp-image-7917" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2021/05/photo5836733815530304569.jpg" alt="" data-id="7917" data-link="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//?attachment_id=7917#main" /></figure>

</li>
</ul>
</figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then divide the dough into pieces about the size of a walnut, 20 g each, and with each one form a stick about 13 cm long, then join the tips of each stick together forming circles.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="936" height="762" class="wp-image-7919" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2021/05/photo5836733815530304567.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Place the corollas on a baking sheet covered with parchment paper and continue with the preparation until all the dough is used up. I recommend using two baking sheets and baking one at a time.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
