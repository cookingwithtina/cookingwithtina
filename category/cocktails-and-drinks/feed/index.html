<p><strong>Pineapple</strong> is an exotic draining and digestive fruit, a source of organic acids (malic acid, citric acid) and trace elements (calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, potassium; rich in vitamin C and beta-carotene; contains <em>bromelain</em>, an enzyme found in the stem that has an anti-inflammatory action. <strong>Ginger</strong> is a spice that has an important antioxidant action and protects the skin from free radicals. <strong>Turmeric</strong> is a spice known for its antioxidant, immune-stimulating, anti-arthritic, digestive and choleretic properties.</p>
