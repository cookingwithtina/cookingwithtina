										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Colored Vol-au-vents are baskets made from several overlapping layers of puff pastry, brushed with egg and baked in the oven, then filled with soft pea cream and boiled quail eggs, or with mayonnaise, lumpfish eggs and smoked salmon. A must on holiday tables, beautiful to look at and easy to prepare, these canestrini are served as an appetizer or finger food, and can be stuffed in a variety of ways, from sweet to savory. The filling inside them is usually based on meat, fish, vegetables, cheese, and mushrooms; however, the dough from which the vol au vent are made has a neutral taste, which can also be combined with sweet preparations, with creams and fruit. With this filling made with peas, mayonnaise, salmon and eggs you will look great for a buffet with friends or for a family Holiday appetizer!</p>
<blockquote><p>The name &#8220;Vol au vent&#8221; comes from the fact that they are light enough to be carried &#8220;away on the wind.&#8221; Their origin is attributed to French chef Marie-Antoine Carême who allegedly substituted a heavy crust for the light dough. However, in François Marin&#8217;s 1739 cookbook &#8220;<i>Les Dons de Comus</i>,&#8221; which predates Antoine Carême&#8217;s birth, a sweet dessert called &#8220;wind pie&#8221; is mentioned.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"></sup></p></blockquote>
<div class="col-md-6">
<div class="c-recipe__list2 c-typo1--body1 --theme-light3--text-links-interact-orange2">
<p>Ingredients for 10 vol-au-vents:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 puff pastry disks</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="col-md-6 col-md-f40">
<div class="c-recipe__list2 c-typo1--body1 --theme-light3--text-links-interact-orange2">
<ul>
<li>1 egg for brushing</li>
<li>10 quail eggs</li>
<li>150 g frozen peas</li>
<li>2/3 basil leaves</li>
<li>4/5 slices of smoked salmon</li>
<li>mayonnaise to taste</li>
<li>5 lumpfish eggs</li>
<li>salt and pepper</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p>To prepare the filled vol-au-vents, roll out the first puff pastry and cut out disks with a pastry cutter; proceed with the second puff pastry as well. Place the resulting discs on a baking sheet lined with baking paper and brush them with egg, while cupping the center of the remaining discs with a smaller pastry cutter to create many crowns.</p>

<p>Prick the whole discs so that they do not swell excessively in baking, then lay the pierced discs on top of the large discs, 3 each, also &#8216;brushed with egg.</p>

<a href='https://cookingwithtina.github.io//stuffed-vol-au-vent/photo6012704488277784013/#main'><img width="119" height="96" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/05/photo6012704488277784013.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" loading="lazy" /></a>

<p>Bake in a preheated static oven at 200º for about 12 to 14 minutes; take out of the oven and let them cool completely. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8784" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/05/photo6012704488277784012.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="960" /></p>
<blockquote><p>If the bottom has risen a bit after baking, you can gently squish it down with a teaspoon!</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="ILfuVd"><span class="hgKElc">For the filling of the vol-au-vents, boil the peas in lightly salted water, then whisk them together with the basil, a teaspoon of oil, salt and pepper and a tablespoon of cooking water until creamy. For hard-boiled quail eggs, on the other hand, you need to boil them in water for 3-4 minutes from the time they first boil. </span></span> It&#8217;s time to fill your vol-au-vents: so use the pea cream and fill 5, then add one egg each and a sprinkling of oregano.</p>

<p>For salmon vol-au-vents, use mayonnaise, salmon and the lumpfish eggs.</p>

<p>Fold the savory croissants back up, starting with the base: roll it on itself until you reach the tip of the triangle. Lay the newly made savory croissants on a baking sheet lined with baking paper; brush the surface with egg yolk or milk and sprinkle with a few sesame seeds. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8749" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/04/photo5972142022565411042.jpg" alt="" width="1242" height="939" /> Bake your Savory Croissants in a static oven at 200° for 15 to 18 minutes, then take them out of the oven and let them cool. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8750" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/04/photo5972142022565411057.jpg" alt="" width="1272" height="846" /> To make the <strong>Pizzette </strong>, prepare the tomato sauce by heating the oil, sauce, paste, salt and sugar for a few minutes, then let cool <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8752" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/04/photo5972142022565411045.jpg" alt="" width="933" height="834" /> Unroll a rectangular roll of puff pastry directly into a baking dish, cut with a knife along vertical and then horizontal strips to make about 2-inch squares; put a teaspoon of tomato sauce in the center, then close two corners in the middle and add oregano.</p>

<a href='https://cookingwithtina.github.io//puff-pastry-magic-recipes-for-appetizers/photo5972142022565411050/#main'><img width="112" height="96" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/04/photo5972142022565411050.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" loading="lazy" /></a>
<a href='https://cookingwithtina.github.io//puff-pastry-magic-recipes-for-appetizers/photo5972142022565411046/#main'><img width="122" height="96" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/04/photo5972142022565411046.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" loading="lazy" /></a>

<p>Bake in a static oven at 200° for 12 to 15 minutes, then take out of the oven and let cool. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8755" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/04/photo5972142022565411048.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="960" /> To make the Artichoke and Ham <strong>Stuzzichini</strong>, first prepare the artichoke cream by whisking the drained artichokes together with the &#8216;oil and salt until smooth. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8756" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/04/photo5972142022565411049.jpg" alt="" width="909" height="867" /> Unroll the first roll of puff pastry, add the cream the artichokes perfectly over the entire surface, add the well-spread slices of cooked ham and the second layer of puff pastry. With a well-sharpened knife carve a grid first all vertical strips, then all horizontal strips, so as to make squares.</p>

<p>Bake the appetizers in the middle part of a static oven preheated to 200° and let them bake for about 15 minutes, then take them out of the oven and let them cool out of the pan and serve.</p>

<a href='https://cookingwithtina.github.io//puff-pastry-magic-recipes-for-appetizers/photo5972142022565411040/#main'><img width="122" height="96" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/04/photo5972142022565411040.jpg" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" loading="lazy" /></a>

Arrange the rolls on a baking sheet with baking paper, brush them with egg yolk or milk, and bake in a preheated oven at 200° for about 12 to 15 minutes until the pastry is golden brown.</p>

<blockquote><p>Delicious variants for the filling of Croissants, Pizzette or Stuzzichini: you can use cooked ham, salami, speck, crudo, or other cold cuts of your choice; instead of philadelphia and artichokes you can spread some tomato and grana cheese, olive pate, pesto alla genovese, acciunghe pasta, tuna and mayonnaise, pesto and ricotta cheese, ricotta cheese and grana cheese or add to the red and white bases cold cuts, cheeses such as fontina or edamer and vegetables of your choice! You can make pizzas with ricotta, mozzarella or other cheeses..in short really whatever you prefer!</p></blockquote>

<li>2 tablespoons of olive oil</li>
<li>one clove of garlic</li>
<li>parsley</li>
<li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
<li>one buffalo mozzarella</li>
<li>1 egg</li>
<li>100 ml fresh cream</li>
<li>40 g grated parmesan cheese</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Start the preparation from the brisee dough: Place the flour in a well on the work surface or in a bowl or in the blender. Cut the well-cold refrigerated butter into pieces and add it to the flour, working it quickly with your hands so that it crumbles; add the cold water and pinch of salt, a little at a time, always kneading with your other hand.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Continue kneading with your hands until you get a smooth, well-blended dough; form into a round loaf and refrigerate 30 minutes wrapped in plastic wrap.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Prepare the mushrooms: remove any remaining soil with a small brush or cloth, then slice all the mushrooms. Heat the two tablespoons of oil in a pan with the garlic clove cut in half; add the mushrooms and cook over high heat for 5 minutes, deglazing with the wine. Lower the heat, season with salt and pepper and continue cooking for 20 minutes over medium heat. At the end of cooking, remove the garlic, season with parsley, if necessary let the cooking liquid dry for 5/6 minutes on high heat without a lid, then let cool.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>With a whisk, mix the egg with the cream and grated cheese in a bowl. Add the mushroom mixture and stir to combine.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Roll out the brisee dough on a sheet of baking paper greased with oil, using a rolling pin, obtaining a sheet about 3 mm. thick; place it with its baking paper inside a 22-cm-diameter mold, prick the base with the tines of a fork and pour the prepared mixture inside.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Add the lightly squeezed sliced buffalo mozzarella and bake in a static oven preheated to 180° for 40 minutes. When finished baking, unmold the savory pie and let it cool before bringing it to the table.</p>

<p>Beef with tuna sauce is a tasty, fresh, flavorful main course, perfect to enjoy cold for spring and summer lunches and dinners, and it can be prepared in advance. Thin slices of meat (I chose beef rump, but veal is also highly recommended) accompanied by a flavorful sauce made with tuna, mayonnaise and eggs. It is a dish that could be served as an appetizer, also suitable for transporting out of the house for an out-of-town lunch.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>800 g of beef swivel</li>
<li>1 onion</li>
<li>1 carrot</li>
<li>2 tablespoons oil</li>
<li>1 celery stalk</li>
<li>6-7 black peppercorns</li>
<li>1 clove of garlic</li>
<li>1 1/2 liters of water</li>
<li>1 glass of white wine</li>
<li>salt and pepper</li>
<li>3 hard-boiled eggs</li>
<li>150 g tuna in oil</li>
<li>3 tablespoons of mayonnaise</li>
<li>salt</li>
<li>pepper</li>
<li>beef broth to dilute</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Peel and chop the white onion, carrot, and shallot and sauté them in a saucepan with the agio and 3 tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil and a pinch of salt until just golden.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Also put the beef, salt, and peppercorns in the casserole and pour over all the white wine, let it fade. Then add the water, which should cover everything, cover and cook over moderate heat for at least 1 hour. Use the roasting thermometer, inserting it perfectly in the center of the piece of meat to check the internal temperature: when it reaches 65° it will be just pink and ready to eat.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1076" height="908" class="wp-image-8687" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/03/photo5868676831635421407.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>At this point, move the meat to a bowl and let it cool completely; you can use the meat stock for other preparations, such as risotto or <a href="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//ragu-di-carne/">meat sauce</a>, taking care to set aside a couple of tablespoons for the tonnata sauce.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, move on to preparing the tonnata sauce: boil the eggs (when boiling, count 9 minutes of cooking time), then let them cool. In a blender put the hard-boiled yolks, add the drained tuna, mayonnaise, salt and pepper, and finally add a little broth. Blend until smooth and of the consistency you prefer.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="868" height="774" class="wp-image-8688" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/03/photo5868676831635421409.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thinly slice the now-warm meat with a smooth-bladed knife; arrange the slices in a serving dish and pour the resulting cream, making layers with the meat slices: cover with plastic wrap and leave to set in the refrigerator a few hours before serving.</p>

<p>Grilled Eggplant is an easy, light, quick and tasty vegetable side dish made with slices of eggplant grilled and then seasoned with a fragrant marinade of oil, garlic, mint and embellished with olives. This flavorful dish is perfect to pair with any dish, such as grilled meat or fish, with cheeses and cured meats or; you can serve it as an appetizer, to stuff sandwiches or crostini. Also, once consumed, you can use the remaining oil to dress pasta!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>3 eggplants</li>
<li>extra virgin olive oil to taste. (about two cups)</li>
<li>100 g green or black olives, pitted</li>
<li>3/4 cloves of garlic</li>
<li>2 hot peppers</li>
<li>coarse salt</li>
<li>pepper to taste</li>
<li>mint leaves</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Begin preparation by slicing the eggplant with a long, sharp knife or a mandoline to a thickness of about 4 to 5 mm.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1095" height="903" class="wp-image-7903" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2021/05/photo5818665171583874943.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Heat a grill well, add a little coarse salt and begin grilling the eggplant slices, for about 2 to 3 minutes on each side, or until the black stripes typical of well-grilled vegetables appear. As you grill, add a little more coarse salt to the grill.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1206" height="942" class="wp-image-7904" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2021/05/photo5818665171583874950.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, prepare the high-sided baking dish where you will put the eggplant: on the bottom put a little olive oil, a couple of mint leaves, a couple of pieces of fresh garlic, pepper.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1143" height="771" class="wp-image-7905" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2021/05/photo5818665171583874945.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lay the grilled eggplant slices in the marinade, so that they fill the bottom. Add on top of the eggplant layer some more oil, garlic, olives, pepper, and if you like a chili pepper too!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1173" height="843" class="wp-image-7906" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2021/05/photo5818665171583874947.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Intersperse with more eggplant, and proceed this way, in layers, until you run out of ingredients. Go ahead and abound with the &#8216;olive oil, then you will reuse it to season the pasta, nothing goes to waste in the kitchen! In the &#8216;last layer add olives, garlic and mint.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally let them marinate for at least 30 minutes before serving, even better if you let them sit in the fridge overnight! You can serve your mouthwatering eggplant cold as well!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can alternatively use a glass jar, always proceeding in layers, perfect for gifting eggplant to friends and family!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yorkshire Pudding is a typical preparation of Anglo-Saxon cuisine, particularly the county of Yorkshire. This fluffy and tasty souffle is served as a side dish and is prepared simply with eggs, milk and flour; but its uniqueness lies in its shape: in fact, it has a &#8220;hole&#8221; in the center, which is ideal for accommodating sauces, meat cooking juices, such as classic roast beef, or roasts, stews or sausages. Puddings are served at Sunday lunches; traditionally it is baked in the oven under the roast: the fat released in cooking goes to enhance the cooking of the pudding and helps flavor this delicious dish. You can serve them with smoked salmon, or stuffed with pate or anything else you like, such as sliced meats and cheeses, for a truly original brunch!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ingredients for 8 Puddings:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>400 g Whole Milk</li>
<li>150 gr of 00 flour</li>
<li>80 gr seed oil</li>
<li>2 eggs</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>a pinch of pepper</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To prepare the Yorkshire pudding, take two muffin pans and pour the seed oil inside 8 molds, distributing it evenly. Place the pan in the static oven preheated to 200° and heat the oil for about 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Without the Bimby: Beat the eggs with the milk, pepper and salt in a large bowl. Gradually add the flour, stirring with a whisk until the &#8216;mixture is smooth and lump-free.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pour the batter into the hot muffin pan (be careful not to burn yourself with the hot oil) and bake again at 200° for 25 minutes, never opening the oven. Once baked, the muffin tarts will look nice and puffy and then tend to deflate to their characteristic irregular shape-let them cool slightly before unmolding and serving your Yorkshire pudding!</p>

<p>Yorkshire pudding can also be enjoyed cold, with sliced meats and cheeses; the center hole can then be used to insert your favorite ingredients. Yorkshire pudding can also be used as an alternative to bread, and since it has a rather neutral taste, it is perfect to try with jam or sweet cream.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ingredients for 9 Blinis:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>200 gr of Milk</li>
<li>40 g of 00 flour</li>
<li>a pinch of sugar</li>
<li>one egg</li>
<li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
<li>100 gr buckwheat flour</li>
<li>20 gr fresh brewer&#8217;s yeast, or a sachet of the dry kind</li>
<li>seed oil for baking</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To garnish:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>Smoked salmon</li>
<li>Smoked tuna</li>
<li>40 g melted butter</li>
<li>dill</li>
<li>jams or compotes</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>With the Bimby:</strong> Pour the milk, brewer&#8217;s yeast and sugar into the mug and heat slightly for <strong>1 minute 30 seconds/37°/ speed 1</strong>. Add 00 flour, buckwheat flour, egg, half teaspoon salt and pepper: <strong>30 seconds/speed 4</strong>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="850" height="740" class="wp-image-7528" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2021/03/photo5920460852891333726.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Without the Bimby</strong>: Warm the milk in a small saucepan, then turn off and melt the yeast together with the sugar; in a separate bowl mix the two flours, add the milk at a trickle, continuing to stir with a whisk to prevent lumps from forming. Then add the egg, salt and pepper and mix until the dough is smooth and rather liquid.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Let the dough rest and rise for about an hour in a dry place.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Heat and grease a nonstick pan for crepes with a little seed oil; when it is hot, place a couple of ladles of dough in it, which will swell to form crepes. When the bottom has firmed up turn the blinis over with the help of a spatula and brown the other side as well. Continue in this way until all the mixture is finished.</p>

<p>You can serve the blinis with sour cream or cream cheese (like philadelphia) or Greek yogurt instead of melted butter, and replace the salmon with shrimp, ham, caviar, or lumpfish roe.

<p>The batter-fried squash blossoms are a tasty, crispy appetizer suitable for any occasion and impossible to resist. Perfect for dinner as an appetizer, or at cocktail hour, fried squash blossoms are super easy and quick to prepare, and everyone really likes them.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>8 squash blossoms</li>
<li>100 g 00 flour</li>
<li>1 egg</li>
<li>120 ml milk</li>
<li>salt, pepper to taste</li>
<li>seed oil for frying</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Start by preparing the pumpkin flower batter: work the egg with a pinch of salt and pepper with a whisk, add first the milk then the flour and mix until smooth, soft and without lumps. Let the batter rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes, covered with plastic wrap.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="960" height="918" class="wp-image-7423" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2021/02/photo5821260036205295482.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, take care of cleaning the squash blossoms: gently detach the stem, outer pistils and inner bud; repeat the same operation for all the other squash blossoms. Wash them gently in cold water, drain and let them dry.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="936" height="912" class="wp-image-7424" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2021/02/photo5821260036205295483.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pour the oil into a pan and bring it to a temperature of 160-170° maximum (get a kitchen thermometer to do this); then dip the flowers into the batter and using tongs turn them over so that they are entirely covered. Then remove each flower from the batter, letting the excess drip off, and dip a few pieces at a time into the hot oil</p>
